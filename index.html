<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain technology is changing how businesses operate.
With trust built into blockchain solutions, it is important to understand how
this new technology is different and how it works in comparison with
technologies of the past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, we cover the main concepts of what blockchain is and
some of its major characteristics. We take you through the important players in
this diverse community. We discuss how it began, first introduced for the
administration of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, and how it is now applied to all
aspects of business including government, banking, supply chains, and other
industries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we analyze the mechanics of blockchains and how they
work. We will cover the concept of transparent ledgers, public and
permissioned, and focus on using cryptography to achieve consensus,
immutability, and transparency. This is all part of blockchain's ability to
provide &quot;trusted data from untrusted sources&quot;, disrupting traditional
accounting methodologies and international trade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will cover some of the functions of blockchain. You will
discover the power of the smart contract, the building blocks for transactions
on the blockchain. You will gain an understanding of the different blockchain
structures and how start up decisions influence how your blockchain deals with
security, identity, consensus, and governance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We then dive into the various methods of blockchain
governance. You will understand how different governance models dictate how
your blockchain operates, and gain insight into consortiums and how this
transformative technology is creating new avenues of communication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we examine the problems blockchain solves that have
been difficult to overcome in the past with more centralized architectures,
discovering how blockchain tackles the double spend issue, creates autonomy and
transparency while facilitating innovative ways for multiple parties to
interact. You will then discover the new and creative ways blockchain is
changing the future. New insights and models dealing with Identity will be
explored. You will look at trends in Decentralized Finance, NFT (non-fungible tokens),
CBDC (central bank digital currencies) and how the push for interoperability
between blockchains is becoming increasingly important.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175339">1b. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)</a></h3>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175340">Background - The Rising Interest in Distributed
Ledger Technologies</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Looking back to the last half century of computer
technologies and architectures,&nbsp;you may observe a trend of fluctuation
between the centralization and subsequent decentralization of computing power,
storage, infrastructure, protocols, and code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mainframe computers are largely centralized. They typically
house all computing power, memory, data storage, and code. Access to mainframes
is mainly by &quot;dumb terminals&quot;, which only take inputs and outputs,
and do not store or process data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the advent of personal computers and private networks,
similar computational capabilities were now housed both on the clients, as well
as the servers. This, in part, gave rise to the &quot;client-server&quot;
architecture, which supported the development of relational database systems.
Massive data sets, which are housed on mainframes, could move onto a
distributed architecture. This data could replicate from server to server, and
subsets of the data could be accessed and processed on clients, and then, synced
back to the server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over time, Internet and cloud computing architectures
enabled global access from a variety of computing devices; whereas mainframes
were largely designed to address the needs of large corporations and
governments. Even though this &quot;cloud architecture&quot; is decentralized
in terms of hardware, it has given rise to application-level centralization
(e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, we are witnessing the transition from centralized
computing, storage, and processing to decentralized architectures and systems.
According to&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'><a
href="https://medium.com/@muneeb/the-next-wave-of-computing-743295b4bc73"
target="_blank"><span style='color:black'>Muneeb Ali</span></a></span></span>,
these systems aim to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;give explicit control of
digital assets to end-users and remove the need to trust any third-party
servers and infrastructure&quot;</span></em>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Distributed ledger technology is one of the key innovations
making this shift possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A distributed ledger is a type of data structure which
resides across multiple computer devices, generally spread across locations or
regions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Distributed ledger technology (DLT) includes blockchain
technologies and smart contracts. While distributed ledgers existed prior to
Bitcoin, the Bitcoin blockchain marks the convergence of a host of
technologies, including timestamping of transactions, Peer-to-Peer
(P2P)&nbsp;networks, cryptography, and shared computational power, along with a
new consensus algorithm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, distributed ledger technology generally consists
of <b>three</b> basic components:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A language of transactions that changes the ledger state</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A protocol used to build consensus among participants around
which transactions will be accepted, and in what order, by the ledger.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175341">Blockchain</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>According to&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:black'><a href="https://hyperledger.org/about" target="_blank"><span

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;A&nbsp;blockchain is a
peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for
&quot;smart contracts&quot; and other assistive technologies. Together these
can be used to build a new generation of transactional applications that
establishes trust, accountability, and transparency at their core, while
streamlining business processes and legal constraints.&quot;</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart contracts are simply computer programs that execute
predefined actions when certain conditions within the system are met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consensus refers to a system of ensuring that parties agree
to a certain state of the system as the true state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain&nbsp;is a specific form or subset of distributed
ledger technologies (DLTs), which constructs a chronological chain of blocks,
hence the name &quot;block-chain&quot;. Examples of other DLTs are Chain Core,
Corda, Quorum, and IOTA. They will be covered later in this chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A&nbsp;block&nbsp;refers to a set of transactions that are
bundled together and added to the chain at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Timestamping is another key feature of blockchain
technology. Each block is timestamped, with each new block referring to the
previous block. Combined with&nbsp;cryptographic hashes, this timestamped chain
of blocks provides an immutable record of all transactions in the network, from
the very first (or genesis) block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner nodes bundle
unconfirmed and valid transactions into a block. Each block contains a given
number of transactions. In the Bitcoin network, miners must solve a
cryptographic challenge to propose the next block. This process is known as
&quot;proof of work&quot;, and requires significant computing power. We shall
discuss proof of work in more detail in the Consensus Algorithms section.

<p class=MsoNormal>The Merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree,&nbsp;is a
data structure that is used to store hashes of the individual data in large
datasets in a way to make the verification of the dataset efficient. It is an
anti-tamper mechanism to ensure that the large dataset has not been changed.
The word &quot;tree&quot; is used to refer to a branching data structure in
computer science, as seen in the image below. According to Andreas M.

<h3><a name="_Toc91175343">1e. What is a Blockchain?</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what is blockchain?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the Security Maven at Hyperledger, I have somewhat of a
different perspective on what a blockchain is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm a developer, primarily, and I look at the world in an
adversarial way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's usually my software versus the world kind of thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchains, to me, definitely open up the world of
possibilities for solving problems that have plagued us for many years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It breaks down to being able to create distributed consensus
between mutuallyÂ  distrustful parties, in many ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It also allows us to create an instantaneous single source
of truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the past, we've always had problems with trying to figure
out what really happened over the course of a day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Banks reconcile their books, inventory systems clear sales
and deliveries...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With blockchains, we're recording things in real time, and
it provides us with sort of an up-to-date accounting of the state of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, a lot of these old systems are going away, a lot of the
work load management systems are going away. We're not doing batch processing
at night anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, we're doing validation in real time, and we always
know the state of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This opens up a whole new host of applications that can be
based around...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we knew exactly where every bolt was, could we make sure
that there are always bolts at the place where they're going to be installed
two minutes before they are needed... things like that...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, like lean manufacturing is one case...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, it also applies to every other process in the world
where we have to track materials and effort, and money, things like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me think...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, the blockchain, for me, actually is just sort of
rethinking of our existing business processes around how we can be more
effective when we know the state of the world as it is right now, and we know
it in two minutes, and we know it in two hours, rather than having to wait
until the end of the day for everything to be reconciled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is actually a transition from human scale to computer
scale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was... all of these processes were done on a daily
basis, and things like that, and with blockchain, we're now... we're doing it
instantaneous, because computers have made it that way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From a security perspective, blockchains are not a silver
bullet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're not going to replace the existing business logic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're more of a log-based system, so recording what has
happened, as it is happening, rather than being the source of what to do with
money from a customer, and things like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's not business process type of software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because it is a log, and because it is the source of truth,
and because a lot of other business logic will be based upon it, the security
concerns on it, related to blockchain, are roughly the same as existing
business practices, or business logic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have to think of all the members of a distributed ledger
as participating in a closed network, because that's what they are, at least in
permissioned networks, we're not operating on the public Internet, we're not
operating in a trustless environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's the exact opposite. We... all the participants in the
distributed ledger are known, they're permissioned, that's where that term
comes from, and they all participate as if they are in a private network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when deploying blockchain software, it's typically done
behind a firewall, and, anytime you have multiple organizations participating
in the distributed ledger, we will use tunneling technology and other VPN
firewall tricks to make a virtual LAN exist, so that all of their organizations
can talk over it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Different Hyperledger projects have different trade-offs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fabric, for instance, has a more centralized ordering
service, and so, it makes more sense to organize one of those networks into a
hub-and-spoke model, where each peer connects to the ordering service, which is
run either on one of the nodes, or on a neutral third party, and all of the
gossip messages that do the consensus mechanism go through a central hub.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, that sounds counterintuitive because just distributed
ledgers are supposed to be distributed...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they still are, they're distributed in the sense that the
blockchain itself is replicated amongst all of the nodes, and so, your data is
much more resilient to disruption...Â  resilient against disruption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The coordination can still be done in a fairly centralized
manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Sawtooth, it is not so much the case, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The organization of the network for Sawtooth is probably
more of like a star model, where you pick some subset of nodes, and your node
connects to those and, as long as all nodes are fairly well connected, they can
all eventually talk to each other, either one hop, or two hops, or three hops
away, depending on the size of your network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Iroha, they... their topology is a lot different than
the others, because they designed their distributed ledger to function well in
a mobile environment, where a lot of the clients are intermittently connected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, they're mobile phones that can be connected and
disconnected at random.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, their structure is more of a layered network, where the
end clients' mobileÂ  phones submit transactions to servers, which then, amongst
the servers, do the distributed ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there's no right answer, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The business process dictates which one you choose, but the
security is pretty much the same in all of these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We use cryptography and digital signatures to validate all
the messages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, tampering with messages is essentially impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The immutability of the distributed ledger is guaranteed by
the cryptography, but the nature of the trusted network, of the permissioned
network, means that we have to treat it like any other back-office service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You want to deploy it behind a firewall, you want to use
tunneling to connect between nodes across the Internet, and you want to
maintain it, just like any other service that deals with Internet traffic...you
have firewalls, and load balancers, and things like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's all I've got to say about security. And thanks for
taking our course.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175344">1f. Transactions</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The record of an event, cryptographically secured with a
digital signature, that is verified, ordered, and bundled together into blocks,
form the transactions in the blockchain. In the Bitcoin blockchain,
transactions involve the transfer of bitcoins, while in other blockchains,
transactions may involve the transfer of any asset or a record of some service
being rendered. Furthermore, a smart contract within the blockchain may allow
automatic execution of transactions upon meeting predefined criteria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cryptography has a key role to play both in the security, as
well as in the immutability of the transactions recorded on blockchains.
Cryptography is the study of the techniques used to allow secure communication
between different parties and to ensure the authenticity and immutability of
the data being communicated. For blockchain technologies, cryptography is used
to prove that a transaction was created by the right person. It is also used to
link transactions into a block in a tamper-proof way, as well as create the
links between blocks, to form a blockchain.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175345">1g. Differences Between Blockchains &amp; Databases</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain technology has some key differentiators from
databases.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A blockchain is a write-only data structure, where new
entries get appended onto the end of the ledger. Every new block gets appended
to the blockchain by linking to the previous block's &quot;hash&quot; (you can
check the&nbsp;<i>Glossary</i>&nbsp;tab for a refresher on hash functions).
There are no administrator permissions within a blockchain that allow editing
or deleting of data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a relational database, data can be easily modified or
deleted. Typically, there are database administrators who may make changes to
any part of the data and/or its structure. Additionally, blockchains were
designed for decentralized applications, whereas relational databases, in
general, were originally designed for centralized applications, where a single
entity controls the data.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175346">Types of Blockchains</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>A blockchain can be

style='background:white'>&nbsp;blockchain, because anyone can join the network.

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
background:white'>private</span></em><span style='background:white'>&nbsp;blockchain,
requires pre-verification of the participating parties within the network, and
these parties are usually known to each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=386 height=202 id="Types of Blockchains, image004.png" src="https://github.com/bbauska/LFS171x/blob/main/images/image004.png?raw=true"
alt="Types of Blockchains"></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The choice between permissionless versus permissioned
blockchains should be driven by the particular application at hand (or use
case). Most enterprise use cases involve extensive vetting before parties agree
to do business with each other. An example where a number of businesses
exchange information is supply chain management. The supply chain management is
an ideal use case for permissioned blockchains. You would only want trusted
parties participating in the network. Each participant that is involved in the
supply chain would require permissions to execute transactions on the
blockchain. These transactions would allow other companies to understand where
in the supply chain a particular item is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the contrary, when a network can &quot;commoditize&quot;
trust, facilitating parties to transact without necessarily having to verify
each other's identity, like the Bitcoin blockchain, a permissionless blockchain
is more suitable. Many of these instances involve the sale or distribution to
the public. Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (which are not backed

<h3><a name="_Toc91175347">Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Historically, most applications utilize a central server (or
servers). For one user/client to send a message to another user/client in the
network, the request has to be sent to the hub or a central server, which then
directs it to the right computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks were first made popular by
Napster (and later BitTorrent) and consist of computer systems which are
directly connected to each other via the Internet, without a central server.
Peers contribute to the computing power and storage that is required for the
upkeep of the network. P2P networks are generally considered to be more secure
than centralized networks, as they do not have a single&nbsp;<em><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:black'>point of attack</span></em>, as in the case of a server-based
network, where the security of the entire network can be compromised if the
central server is successfully attacked.&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;

created by the World Economic Forum,&nbsp;reveals&nbsp;a grim picture:
cyberattacks are on the rise at an alarming rate, and financial costs related
to them are skyrocketing, with&nbsp;more than 25% increase year-over-year. It
is estimated that cybercrime will cost businesses more than $8 trillion over
the next five years.&nbsp;And the damages go far beyond financial costs: they
affect critical, strategic infrastructure, such as telecommunications
providers, energy companies, government agencies, banks, hospitals, and much
more. As a result, large corporations and federal governments invest
significant amounts of financial resources to fortify their central
servers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Permissionless P2P systems do not require a set amount of
peers to be online&nbsp;and are generally slower. Permissioned P2P networks
have to guarantee uptime&nbsp;and require a high level of quality of service on
the communication links.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175348">Peer-to-Peer Networks (Robert Schwentker)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is a Peer-to-Peer network, and how do peers come to
agreement about what is on the blockchain?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A blockchain network is a group of computers that informally
are organized in a Peer-to-Peer architecture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consensus is a process whereby the peers synchronize the
data on the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a number of consensus mechanisms or algorithms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One is Proof of Work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another is Proof of Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's also Proof of Elapsed Time, as well as Simplified
Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin uses Proof of Work, while Ethereum uses Proof of
Work currently, but is moving towards Proof of Stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hyperledger Sawtooth uses Proof of Elapsed Time.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175349">Immutability of Data</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The immutability of the data which sits on the blockchain is
perhaps the most powerful and convincing reason to deploy blockchain-based
solutions for a variety of socio-economic processes which are currently
recorded on centralized servers. This immutability, or &quot;unchanging over
time&quot;&nbsp;feature makes the blockchain useful for accounting, financial
transactions, identity management, and asset ownership, management and
transfer, just to name a few examples. Once a transaction is written onto the
blockchain, no one can change it, or, at least, it would be extremely difficult
to change it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>According to&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:black'><a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gentle-introduction-immutability-blockchains-antony-lewis/"
target="_blank"><span style='color:black'>Antony Lewis</span></a></span></span>,&nbsp;the
Director of Research at R3,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;When people say that
blockchains are immutable, they don't mean that the data can't be changed, they
mean it is extremely hard to change without collusion, and if you try, it's
extremely easy to detect the attempt</span></em>&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's dig into this statement a bit further. It is extremely
hard to change the transactions in a blockchain, because each block is linked
to the previous block by including the previous block's hash. This hash
includes the Merkle root hash of all the transactions in the previous block. If
a single transaction were to change, not only would the Merkle root hash
change, but so too would the hash contained in the changed block. In addition,
each subsequent block would need to be updated to reflect this change. In the
case of proof of work, the amount of energy required to recalculate the nonce
for this block and each subsequent block would be prohibitive. On the other
hand, if someone did modify a transaction in a block without going through the
necessary steps to update the subsequent blocks, it would be easy to
recalculate the hashes used in the blocks and determine that something is
amiss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's look at an example of how this works. In the following
diagram, we see the&nbsp;original blocks and the transactions for Block 11.
Specifically, we see that the Merkle root for the transactions in Block 11
is&nbsp;<strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>Hash #ABCD</span></strong>, which is the
combined hash for the four transactions in this block. Now, let's say that
someone comes in and attempts to change Transaction A to Transaction A'. This,
in turn, modifies the hashes that are stored in the Merkle tree, and the Merkle
root changes to&nbsp;<strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>Hash #A'BCD</span></strong>. In
addition, the Previous Block hash stored in Block 12 also needs to be modified
to reflect the overall change in the hash for Block 11.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175350">Blockchain Applications</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since blockchain is a form of digital infrastructure,
applications built on top of a blockchain provide a gateway to accessing
information that sits on that blockchain. In other words, clients/users interact
with the blockchain through applications. Starting from the simple wallets that
hold bitcoins, sophisticated applications which encompass applications
addressing digital identity (e.g. UPort, KYC-Chain, Netki, etc.), and complex
financial transactions are being built on the blockchain.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175351">Smart Contracts</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is a smart contract?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in 1996, a man named Nick Szabo coined the term 'smart
contract'.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can think of them as computer protocols used to
facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation of a legal contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A smart contract is a phrase to describe computer code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, Ethereum smart contracts are designed to run on all
nodes of the Ethereum network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those smart contracts facilitate the exchange of value,
including money, content, property, or shares between a fixed number of
parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart contracts are simply computer programs that execute
predefined actions when certain conditions within the system are met. Smart
contracts provide the language of transactions that allow the ledger state to
be modified. They can facilitate the exchange and transfer of anything of value
(e.g. shares, money, content, property).</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175352">Bitcoin Â A Popular Blockchain Deployment</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the invention of&nbsp;the peer-to-peer (P2P) cash
system known as Bitcoin in 2008, we have an example of&nbsp;a global
decentralized payment network with a distributed and publicly-owned
infrastructure, operating as a &quot;permissionless&quot; system. There&nbsp;is
a persuasive case&nbsp;that Bitcoin is the first &quot;killer application&quot;

technologies since the inception of the Bitcoin payment system. Hundreds of
large companies, and dozens of governments and universities have become
actively involved in researching, testing, and prototyping blockchain protocols,
platforms, and applications. In particular, the financial services sector has
been actively investing in exploring wider applications of distributed ledger
technologies (of which, blockchain is a subset) since late 2015.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175353">Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why were Bitcoin and Ethereum created? What problems do they
solve?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin was first launched in January of 2009, as a response
to the global financial crisis at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the motivation for the system was to be able to
transfer value over the internet, without an intermediary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the biggest inventions and problems that it solved
was that of the 'double spend' problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin, in fact, is programmable money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethereum, on the other hand, was created as a response to
Bitcoin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Bitcoin is focused upon transferring monetary value
between parties, it has a very limited programming language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethereum, on the other hand, uses a more expansive set of
programming languages and tools to allow for many other types of programs and
applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The core invention of Ethereum is it's EVM, or Ethereum
Virtual Machine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EVM runs on the Ethereum network, and it runs a
Turing-complete software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, Vitalik Buterin is the person who wrote the white paper
for Ethereum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of its key features include the immutability of data,
that unauthorized users cannot make changes to that data, the Ethereum
development platform is designed to make corruption and tamper proof
applications, the secure apps are sent decentralized and secured with
cryptography, and they're protected against hacking attacks and fraudulent
activities, and lastly, it's designed with zero downtime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is because the applications on the network are
decentralized, and on many, many machines, if some of those machines go down,
the Ethereum network maintains a stable state of the Ethereum network.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175354">Bitcoin and Cryptoeconomics</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bitcoin has also ushered in tremendous academic and research
interest in the area of Cryptoeconomics and Cryptoeconomic security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other words, the field of Cryptoeconomics explores the
intersection of cryptography and economic incentives. While cryptography is
used for ensuring network security at various levels and functions, the
built-in economic incentives provided to the participating nodes in the network
ensures that, at any given point, the majority of players in the network
operate in a desirable way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Ethereum network is a distributed global public network,
which means it is not run on central servers in a certain geographical
location. Instead, the computing power that runs the network is contributed by
nodes that are spread across the globe. In other words, Dapps have &quot;zero
downtime&quot; - they never go down and, in general, cannot be switched off.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175358">Ethereum Smart Contracts</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A hypothetical example of an Ethereum-based smart contract
may involve the following transaction: in an equity raise, transfer amount X
from the investor to the company upon receiving the given shares from the
company. The monetary amount X, which was pre-validated by the company for the
transaction (much like in a credit card purchase), is held in escrow by the
smart contract, until the shares have been received by the investor. Any kind
of arbitrary sophisticated business logic can be committed to the blockchain.
The Ethereum blockchain only encodes these &quot;rules of the games&quot;. The
actual payoffs occur by interacting with the blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The illustration below describes this process. The smart
contract encodes the agreement between the company raising funds and its
investors (Panel 1). The smart contract sits on the Ethereum public blockchain,
and is run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Once hitting a triggering
event, like an expiration date or a strike price that has been pre-coded, the
smart contract automatically executes as per the business logic (Panel 2). As
an added benefit, regulators are able to scrutinize the market activity on an
ongoing basis, without compromising the identity of specific players in a
permissionless public blockchain, as Ethereum (Panel 3).</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175359">Exploring Permissionless Blockchains</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>We will&nbsp;examine the
Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains,&nbsp;both of which are permissionless, public
blockchains. We will examine several large transactions, and the genesis block
for each blockchain. We will look at block heights, transaction times, mining
pools, timestamps, and block rewards.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175360">Exploring Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's take a look at a couple of public blockchains: those
of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and let's examine the genesis block, or the first block,
of each one of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, we'll take a look at a couple of large transactions,
including the most famous transaction in cryptocurrency history: the purchase
of a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, we'll go to this blockchain explorer, and see that there
is a Height column, which indicates the number of blocks in this particular
blockchain; it's nearing a half a million.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These blocks are created approximately every 10 minutes, and
there's a Transactions column that shows how many transactions are included in
each block, as well as the Total Sent, or the amount of Bitcoin that was
transferred in each of those blocks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, you can notice that there's... they relate by
column, which is essentially the miner or mining pool that created that block.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From here, let's take a look at another blockchain explorer,
and you can see here the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notice that the timestamp is January 3rd 2009.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, that's the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, moving on to the EthereumÂ  blockchain, we'll look at
another blockchain explorer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this one shows you that there's approximately 5 million
blocks in the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notice that each block is created much more quickly than in
the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From here, we'll examine the genesis block of the Ethereum
blockchain, and notice that it was mined about two years ago, and the mining
reward for this was approximately five ether.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, from here, we'll take a look at the very interesting
transaction: that of the pizza transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Bitcoin Forum, there was somebody on May 18th of 2010 who
was requesting that they would pay 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They provided their address and someone in fact sent them a
pizza. In fact, it was from Europe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And you can see here that that was this transaction here: of
10,000 bitcoins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And lastly, a very large and interesting transaction of 658
bitcoins, done recently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notice that the value of that is close to 3 million dollars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, you can examine these transactions on both the Bitcoin and
Ethereum blockchains, and many other blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Chapter 2 of this course, we'll touch upon the
Hyperledger Explorer, which can be configured to examine blockchains you might
develop with other of the Hyperledger frameworks.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175361">Consensus Algorithms</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consensus in the network refers to the process of achieving
agreement among the network participants as to the correct state of data on the
system. Consensus leads to all nodes sharing the exact same data. A consensus
algorithm, hence, does two things: it ensures that the data on the ledger is
the same for all the nodes in the network, and, in turn, prevents malicious
actors from manipulating the data. The consensus algorithm varies with
different blockchain implementations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the Bitcoin blockchain uses Proof of Work as the
consensus algorithm, other blockchains and distributed ledgers are deploying a
variety of consensus algorithms, like the Proof of Stake, Proof of Burn, Proof
of Capacity, Proof of Elapsed Time, and many others, depending on their unique
requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will briefly explain some of these algorithms.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175362">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Proof of Work consensus algorithm involves solving a
computational challenging puzzle in order to create new blocks in the Bitcoin
blockchain. Colloquially, the process is known as 'mining', and the nodes in
the network that engage in mining are known as &quot;miners&quot;. The
incentive for mining transactions lies in economic payoffs, where competing
miners are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins and a small transaction fee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As described in the&nbsp;2016 Kudelski Security report,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;Proof-of-work (PoW) is the
outcome of a successful mining process and, although the proof is hard to
create, [it] is easy to verify&quot;.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For better understanding, please consider the following
example provided by&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"inherit",serif;color:black'><a
href="https://99bitcoins.com/proof-of-work-proof-of-stake/" target="_blank"><span
style='color:black'>Ofir Beigel</span></a></span></span>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;(...) guessing a combination
to a lock is a proof to a challenge. It is very hard to produce this since you
will need to guess many different combinations; but once produced, it is easy
to validate. Just enter the combination and see if the lock opens&quot;</span></em>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Multiple criticisms exist for the PoW consensus algorithm.
PoW requires a huge amount of energy to be expended, given the computationally
heavy algorithm. In addition, PoW has a high latency of transaction validation,
and the concentration of mining power is located in countries where electricity
is cheap. In terms of the network security, PoW is susceptible to the &quot;51%
attack&quot;, which refers to an attack on a blockchain by a group of miners
controlling more than 50% of the network's computing power.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175363">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>The Proof of Stake algorithm
is a generalization of the Proof of Work algorithm. In PoS, the nodes are known
as the &quot;validators&quot; and, rather than mining the blockchain, they
validate the transactions to earn a transaction fee. There is no mining to be
done, as all coins exist from day one. Simply put, nodes are randomly selected
to validate blocks, and the probability of this random selection depends on the
amount of stake held. So, if node X owns 2 coins and node Y owns 1 coin, node X
is twice as likely to be called upon to validate a block of transactions. The
specific implementation of PoS can vary, depending on the use case, or as a
matter of software design. Instances include&nbsp;</span><span

target="_blank"><span style='color:black'>Proof of Burn</span></a></span></span><span
style='background:white'>. The PoS algorithm saves expensive computational
resources that are spent in mining under a PoW consensus regime.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175364">Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developed by Intel, the Proof of Elapsed Time consensus
algorithm emulates the Bitcoin-style Proof of Work. Hyperledger's Sawtooth
implementation is an example of PoET at work. Instead of competing to solve the
cryptographic challenge and mine the next block, as in the Bitcoin blockchain,
the PoET consensus algorithm is a hybrid of a random lottery and
first-come-first-serve basis. In PoET, each validator is given a random wait
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;The validator with the
shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the
leader&quot;.</span></em><i><br>

<p class=MsoNormal>This &quot;leader&quot; gets to create the next block on the
chain.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175365">Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm
implements an adopted version of the&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span

algorithm, and seeks to provide significant improvements over Bitcoin's Proof
of Work consensus protocol. The basic idea involves a single validator who
bundles proposed transactions and forms a new block. Note that, unlike the
Bitcoin blockchain, the validator is a known party, given the permissioned
nature of the ledger. Consensus is achieved as a result of a minimum number
of&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:black'>other nodes</span></em>&nbsp;in the network ratifying the new
block. In order to be tolerant of a Byzantine fault, the number of nodes that
must reach consensus is&nbsp;<strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Courier New";color:black'>f</span></em><strong><span

where&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Courier New";

example, if we have 7 nodes in the system, then 5 of those nodes must agree if
2 of the nodes are acting in a faulty manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Proof-of-Authority (PoA) is a
consensus algorithm which can be used for permissioned ledgers. It uses a set

a majority of authorities in order for a block to be created.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175369">Hyperledger Blockchains: Permissioned or
Permissionless?</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Hyperledger blockchains are
generally permissioned blockchains, which means that the parties that join the
network are authenticated and authorized to participate on the network.
HyperledgerÂs main goal is to create enterprise grade, open source, distributed
ledger frameworks and code bases to support business use cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<span style='background:white'>Advantages of Using a Permissioned Blockchain
over a Permissionless Blockchain</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look at permissionless blockchains, like the Bitcoin
blockchain or the Ethereum blockchain, anyone can join the network, as well as
write and read transactions. The actors in the system are not known, which
means there could be some malicious actors within the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger reduces these security risks and ensures that
only the parties that want to transact are the ones that are part of the
transaction and, rather than displaying the record of the transactions to the
whole network, they remain visible only to the parties involved. So,
Hyperledger provides all the capabilities of the blockchain architecture - data
privacy, information sharing, immutability, with a full stack of security
protocols - all for the enterprise. Permissioned blockchains&nbsp;offer more
efficient transaction performance, thus being highly scalable, and have a
clearly defined governance structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We kind of model ourselves a little bit after Apache, and
some of the other organizations out there that really are communities of
communities, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within Hyperledger, we have different technology code
projects, essentially.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Projects like Fabric and Sawtooth, and a lot of the others
that all of you will be finding out about, but, what these projects have in
common is a set of development principles around working in the public, around,
you know... even from the earliest ideas, you know, developers should be
sharing that with other developers, right, not just something they build
privately, then throw over the wall, and release this open code, but that
starts out from day one as a public process, right, and multi-stakeholder as
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, while projects do often start out as the work of one
company or one small set of developers, we really come to trust technologies
when we see that there's lots of people both using it and contributing to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, that way, we know this is actually a project that
will likely outlast any one company's commitment to it, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's a good basis for deciding what open source
technologies to build on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, at Hyperledger, we're trying to make sure that each of
these projects fulfills that goal of being multi-stakeholder, of being active
software development projects that get as quickly as possible to a production
release, something that organizations can actually use in real production
environments, and yet, still has the flexibility to explore a new concept, to
explore a new consensus mechanism, a new way of writing smart contracts, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, that balancing act is really what we're trying to strive
for inside of Hyperledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are some examples of other blockchain and distributed
ledger technology systems, and what are their benefits?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chain Core, created by chain.com, has initially been
designed for financial service institutions, and for things like securities,
bonds, and currencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their company has strong ties with Visa, Citigroup, and
Nasdaq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Corda distributed ledger platform is designed to record,
manage, and automate legal agreements between businesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was created by the R3 company, which is a consortium of
over a hundred global financial institutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quorum is a permissioned implementation of Ethereum, which
supports data privacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quorum achieves this data privacy through allowing data visibility
on need-to-know basis by a voting-based consensus algorithm. Interestingly,
Quorum was created and open sourced by JPMorgan.</p>

is the first cryptocurrency that provides the whole ecosystem based on
blockless blockchain&quot;</span></em>&nbsp;to enable machine-to-machine (M2M)
transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IOTA, however, is more than just a cryptocurrency.
Essentially, the platform entails a generalization of the blockchain protocol
(the technology called Tangle) that sits at the backend of the IOTA platform.
The platform uses a Decentralized Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a blockchain
to store its ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead of paying miners to validate the transactions, the
architecture of the network involves peer-based validation. We can think of a
simple&nbsp;analogy, that of a teacher grading students' homework: the students
are the clients/users in the Bitcoin protocol, and the teacher is the
miner/validator. Tangle technology asks students (users) to grade each other's
homework, making the need for a teacher (external validator) redundant, and
avoiding expenses related to the teacher's/validator's work. This allows the
platform to be completely free of cost, without facing the scaling challenges
that are inherent in the first generation of blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, the use of the platform with connected devices

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a number of challenges to the widespread use of
permissioned distributed ledger technologies. Key among them are challenges
around the lack of standards, regulatory challenges, and the lack of knowledge

<h3><a name="_Toc91175377">Standards</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since we are still witnessing the early days of blockchain
technology, there is&nbsp;very little agreement on standards in the developer
and business community, as of yet. Standards are key in ensuring
interoperability and avoiding risks associated with a fragmented ecosystem.
Standards are critical not just for the distributed ledger itself, but also for
supporting services, like identity, privacy, and data governance. Furthermore,
the management of keys, as well as protocols and standards around key loss and
theft, will be critical (<span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal>As a result, the International Organization for
Standardization for Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies was
established in 2016 and has defined areas for future standardization work (<span

<h3><a name="_Toc91175378">Regulation</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lack of regulation around transactions on the blockchain
creates an environment of uncertainty for all players. Highly regulated
industries like financial services are treading carefully in the DLT space. The
Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States has clarified its
stance on&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

target="_blank"><span style='color:black'>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)</span></a></span></span>&nbsp;<span
style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>in 2017. The Chinese government has, in
fact, banned all ICOs, while 60 major ICO platforms are being investigated (</span><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

style='font-family:"inherit",serif'>, 2017).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, there are no regulatory guidelines governing
smart contracts, causing much anxiety among various players like lawyers, regulators,
programmers, and businesses. The lack of regulatory guidelines, along with a
lack of industry standards, exacerbates hindrances to rapid adoption of DLT.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175379">Lack of Know-How</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>The lack of know-how (and
know-whom and know-where) around distributed ledger technologies and the
availability of&nbsp;experts in the area is a major challenge in the adoption
of distributed ledger technologies. While there has been an exponential
increase in the interest around 'blockchain', as indicated in the figure below,
there is a huge lag of technical talent in the space. In fact, the origin of
this course stems from the need to address this gap in know-how.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175382">Hyperledger (Navroop Sahdev)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger is an open source effort created to advance
cross-industry blockchain technologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a global collaboration hosted by The Linux Foundation
that encompasses various industries and organizations worldwide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may think of Hyperledger as an operating system for
marketplaces, data sharing networks, microcurrencies, and decentralized digital
communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A shared goal is to significantly reduce the cost and
complexity of doing business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger blockchains are permissioned blockchains, which
means that the parties that join the network are generally authenticated via an
identity module.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Essentially, Hyperledger blockchains are specifically
designed to be enterprise solutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look at permissionless blockchains, like the Bitcoin
blockchain or the Ethereum blockchain, anyone can join the network, which means
there would invariably be some malicious actors within the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger reduces these security risks, and ensures that
only the parties that want to transact are the ones that are part of the
transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rather than displaying the record of the transactions to the
whole network, they remain within the parties involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, Hyperledger provides all the capabilities of blockchain
architecture, data privacy, information sharing, immutability, with a full
stack of security protocols, all for the enterprise.</p>

broadly applicable blockchain technology really is. This goes way beyond
cryptocurrencies&quot;</span></em>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger&nbsp;provides an alternative to the
cryptocurrency-based blockchain model, and focuses on developing blockchain
frameworks, tools and libraries to support global enterprise solutions. The
focus of Hyperledger is to provide a transparent and collaborative approach to
blockchain development.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175384">The Birth of Hyperledger</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's amazing how quickly Hyperledger has developed and
evolved over the past few years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about the journey
of how Hyperledger has come to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, the Hyperledger Project began when a set of companies
who were starting to pay attention to this Bitcoin space, this cryptocurrency
space, this blockchain space, approached The Linux Foundation and said
&quot;Let's do a project together&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Linux Foundation has been at the heart of the Linux
ecosystem, bringing together companies and developers to try to, you know,
serve, say, air traffic control to the development of a common technology
platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, over the last few years, it has grown into other
related technology spaces: software-defined networking, cloud computing, all
these kinds of things... domains that also needed this focused effort to bring
these two kinds of communities together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, it's very natural when companies like IBM, or even new
ones, that had never worked with The Linux Foundation before, like JPMorgan, or
startups in this space, like Digital Asset, when they started to talk with each
other, and tried to figure out where a good home for this would be, they
approached The Linux Foundation, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, some conversations got started, and there was a sense
that what was interesting about this space wasn't so much the cryptocurrencies,
and, you know, the make-money-fast kind of mentality, but the underlying
distributed ledger and smart contract technology platforms, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there's still a lot of hard work to do to figure out the
right approaches to this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, in December of 2015, The Linux Foundation, in
conjunction with those companies, and about 30 more, announced the launch of
the Hyperledger effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alright, the Hyperledger Project, which we really just call
Hyperledger now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first code drop, meaning the first release of software,
happened just two months later, in February of 2016, when the Fabric codebase
came over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Initially, it had been built inside of IBM, but, when it
came over, it was now part of the community, right, followed soon after by
Sawtooth Lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it wasn't just code; the community started to meet face
to face on a pretty regular basis, about once every two months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this was because there was a lot to sort out, a lot of
knowledge to share.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I joined in May of 2016, so, a little bit of a late comer, I
guess, to the launch of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I joined partly because I saw how transparent, and how
engaging, even from day one, all of these processes have been.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175385">Hyperledger Goals</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Hyperledger has taken a
leadership role to develop cross-industry standards and provide a neutral space
for software collaboration. The financial services industry, in particular, is
witnessing an unprecedented level of collaboration between institutions that
have traditionally been competitors. The advent of a new foundational or
infrastructural technology like the blockchain - much like the Internet -
requires collaboration of various actors in order to realize the full benefits
of the technology. Unless all actors use a certain standard, the pace of
technological dissemination will continue to be slow. Technological adoption is
characterized by network effects, where the costs decrease with the increase in
use of a certain technology. Since shifting to distributed ledger technology
involves significant costs, open source software, communities and ecosystems
that develop around these have a significant part to play.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175386">The Importance of Open Source</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, you had mentioned before how Hyperledger is different
from other consortiums because of its focus on creating an open community, not
just open sourcing code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Can you tell us a little bit about why this is important?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, open source communities, I believe, live and breathe on
not just, you know, reporting bugs or, you know, downloading code, but,
actually, live and breathe on true collaboration, on saying not just, you know,
&quot;I have a bug and somebody needs to fix it&quot;, but, instead, saying
&quot;Here's how I'd like to solve this&quot;, right? What do people think?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Here is a design for implementing a new feature.&quot;
What do people think?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I think the evidence shows that that creates higher
quality code. It also creates more long lasting code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't think you have a project like the Linux kernel,
which has now been around for 26 years, right, without having a mechanism for a
community to develop an institutional memory, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why were certain decisions made? What were some ideas that
were proposed and, ultimately, found to either be shot down or not really good
enough, right, so that we don't end up changing things back and forth, right,
we don't end up making mistakes that we could have avoided before or learning
from previous...how do we make sure we learn from previous mistakes, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's only possible in an open source community if, on
top of just releasing code, you're also engaging in the creative process
itself, and making that public facing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I think, really, we found out over 25 years of open
source that that's the best way to build trustworthy software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe it leads to higher security software and higher
quality software, but really, the question is trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is code that sits... At Hyperledger, this is code that
will sit at the heart of these enterprises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This will be their system of record, right? So, it's
essential that we develop this code in a trustworthy way and, while we do all
sorts of things to help them trust the data in the system, ultimately, they
have to trust the software, as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And what I hope is that, through these processes, they can
rest assured that, when they pick up Hyperledger, anything, right, that
anything will be software that they can trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif'>&quot;Today, most people understand the concept
of Open Source. What many people don't get, and something we here at
Hyperledger and The Linux Foundation pride ourselves on doing well, is Open
Governance</span></em>&quot;.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal>Open source software is software that is made freely
available and may be redistributed and modified. In other words, anyone has the
ability to view the code, use the code, copy the code, change the code, and,
depending on the open source license, contribute back changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Open governance means that technical decisions for an open
source project are made by a group of community-elected developers drawn from a
pool of active participants. These decisions include things such as which
features to add, how, and when to add them.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175390">Software Governance of the Hyperledger Projects
(Brian Behlendorf)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the software governance of all of the Hyperledger
projects work?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, in open source projects you do... it's not a
free-for-all, right? It's not just everybody throwing in every line of code, hoping
that what, you know, it sticks to the wall, and that everything is fine, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There actually is a development process that involves
decision-making about what comes in and what doesn't, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the core of each of the projects at Hyperledger is a set
of maintainers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are individuals who either were with the project when
it came in, as initial maintainers, right, because they had been working on the
code before, or were invited in by that initial set of maintainers to become
maintainers, after demonstrating, you know, a history of contributions to the
project, alright?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are now individuals who are trusted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you're in that group, obviously, everything those
maintainers do is public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If they commit to the source code repository, approve a a
patch, a commit request, or pull request, everything they do is public anyway,
so there's always that accountability for their actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If somebody does something wrong, anybody can always say
&quot;I think that's wrong&quot;, and the set of maintainers can sometimes come
to a decision to reverse a commit, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's within their power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's really up to those maintainers to also chart the path
forward: what's the roadmap, when will we do the next release, right, the next
minor point released, the next major release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, they do that in a public way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes, they'll use a phone call, sometimes, they'll use
chat on Rocket Chat, sometimes, they'll use email, but they know that their job
is to be accountable and responsible to the broader development community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, from a Hyperledger perspective, if we leave it up to
the projects to really decide the roadmap of what they're trying to solve, there's
a group called the Technical Steering Committee, though, that is elected by all
the contributors across all the projects, not even just the
maintainer...anybody who has contributed a line of code, contributed to the
wiki in some substantial way, they elect a group of eleven developers who form
this Technical Steering Committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the TSC is kind of an oversight body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They make sure that the projects are growing, and that
they're healthy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They review activity in those projects, they also approve
new projects when they come in, and they approve the graduation from the
Incubator, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What they don't get to do is, you know, tell us, tell a
project &quot;Hey, you're working on the wrong thing. Go work on this, instead&quot;,
right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They really have to depend on this kind of decentralized
governance, right, to aim in the right direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By and large, we try to make sure though that every project
has some sort of relation to distributed ledgers and smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our goal is not to be the GitHub of distributed ledgers and
smart contracts projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's already a GitHub for that, alright?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We want these projects to be a curated, you know, coherent
portfolio of different projects that might even compete with each other, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In many ways, Fabric and Sawtooth and Iroha do overlap, and
you can build an implementation of something in all three of those. That's
okay, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're going to discover over time how these projects
differentiate with each other, and it's the role of the Technical Steering
Committee, and a bunch of other committees we have around identity, and
architecture, and white papers, and things, to try to weave these different
efforts together in something that looks coherent, something that makes sense for
developers.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175391">Strength Through Diversity</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you familiarize yourself more with Hyperledger and the
blockchain technologies it fosters in its greenhouse, you will notice the
similarities between some of&nbsp;its&nbsp;projects, but most importantly, what
differentiates them from one another and the use cases
they&nbsp;were&nbsp;designed&nbsp;to address. The idea behind this approach was
and continues to be that there is no one solution to address the myriad of
needs, requirements and use cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif'>&quot;Having a portfolio of projects, though,
enables us to have the variety of ideas and contributors to become a strong
open source community... It's not that our multiplicity of projects has given
us strength through numbers, but rather strength through diversity.&quot;</span></em></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175392">Blockchain Security at Hyperledger (David Huseby)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, security with distributed ledgers really begins here at
Hyperledger with our culture of secure software development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every aspect of the software, from development, through
testing, through bug fixing, and vulnerability resolution, it's done in a
completely open process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's open to anybody to participate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have maintainers that do all the code reviews.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Changes to code is driven by requirements, and patches come
in to implement those requirements...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're reviewed... we have requirements for tests to be
written before it's accepted, and we have pretty rigorous testing
infrastructure in place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We use continuous integration, so, it's always building, and
we have also initiated security reviews outside security audits of all our
projects as they approach 1.0.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's that culture that really builds the foundation of
trust for the Hyperledger projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because we're radically transparent, and because we do the
correct things from a software engineering perspective, we deserve the trust
that consumers of our products put in our hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then, building on top of our process, comes all of the cryptography
and the data resiliency that you get with a distributed ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, once we can ship a product, a piece of software that's
been built to the best of our ability, then the guarantees provided by the
cryptography really carry weight, or really, are ironclad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, it's a very holistic approach to security here at
Hyperledger: everything, from the way we write software to the way the software
works.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175393">How Will Hyperledger Change the Blockchain
Ecosystem? (Brian Behlendorf)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do you think Hyperledger will change the industries that
adopt the technology?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, in the Internet era, we, as technologists, have gotten
really good at building big central databases and big central services, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think about the move to the cloud. The move to the cloud
wasn't a move to, youÂ  know, a really dispersed, diffused, decentralized kind
of system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It often meant a move to one company's servers, right, or
one company's products, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I feel like, today, the Internet is more
decentralized... more centralized than it used to be, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that decentralized systems tend to grow quicker, they
tend to be more adaptable, that nature looks a little bit more decentralized,
right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, for businesses, I think you often don't want to be just
sitting on the outside as a satellite on another centralized business, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone would want to be the Uber of this, or the Uber of
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, that's great for Uber and its investors. It's not so
great when you're sitting on the outside, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, a lot of industries kind of want... don't want to see
their own industry move into that centralized approach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, typically, today, to be able to facilitate that, they
have lots of point-to-point integrations, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something like Hyperledger offers the potential for
integration of an industry at a time, right, into a system that can not only
become a system of record for recording transactions between parties in a
network, in a marketplace, but also allow for the automation of a whole bunch
of business processes through the use of smart contracts, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, in a permissioned ledger, you still have an
organization that acts somewhat like the referee on a football field, right, sets
the rules of the game, watches how players play and, if somebody acts out of
turn, even if the technology allows it, if they violate the spirit of the
contract so-to-speak, or the human conditions, then, the referee can kick them
out. And, by the way, if the referee does their job poorly, the two teams can
kick the referee out, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, this type of governance mechanism for something like a
football game, right, is actually not too far from the kind of governance
mechanisms that many industries deploy today, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With distributed ledger technologies like Hyperledger, we
can actually have the information systems work and look a lot more like the way
that the business processes look and work, especially in a more decentralized
setting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can avoid the over-centralization of industries, and the
over-centralization of society through the use of these technologies.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175394">Blockchain for Business</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cryptocurrency-based blockchain model, popularized by
public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, currently falls short of
fulfilling a host of requirements that many types of organizations would have
to fulfill in order to be compliant when using blockchain and distributed
ledger technologies - for instance, in the areas of financial services,
healthcare, and government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger is a unique platform that is developing
permissioned distributed ledger frameworks specifically designed for
enterprises, including those in industries with strong compliance requirements.
Enterprise use cases require capabilities such as scalability and throughput,
built-in or interoperable identity modules for the parties involved in a transaction
or a network, or even access to regulators who can access all data in the
ledger as read-only to ensure compliance. The latter is particularly important
because, regardless of the innovation, it has to operate within the current
regulatory framework, as well as comply with any new rules that come into place
specifically targeted at blockchain technologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The enterprise continues to be at the heart of this course.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175395">Why Businesses Choose to Use Hyperledger? (Brian
Behlendorf)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, as a follow-up, why are businesses choosing to use
Hyperledger over other distributed ledger technologies?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, companies, when they decide what open source
technologies to use, right, they should evaluate an open source project based
on a number of factors, not just, you know, is the code available, does it run,
how mature is it, right, have they released a 1.0, and a 1.1, and a 1.2...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You want to see a kind of a regular stream of these things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also believe companies make decisions... I believe
companies make decisions about what open source technologies to choose based on
the health of the community, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And how many other companies are embedding this technology
inside of their own solutions, right, inside of other products and services, how
many people out there are using it... that sort of thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, at Hyperledger, what we're trying to do is not just
build a very healthy developer ecosystem around our technologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also do a lot to try to talk with our members and others
who are using Fabric, or using Hyperledger Sawtooth, or these other
technologies, to understand where are they using it and what's the value that
they're getting from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And can we talk about that to the outside world, alright,
which is hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes, people don't want to talk about their behind-the-scenes
projects, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we can talk about the application of that in music
licensing, or food supply chain projects, alright, and start to talk about kind
of a higher level impact that these projects can have, then, that I think gets
companies really interested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They don't make the decision to jump in, unless they can see
that this is not just a piece of code, that this is a movement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, that's really what we're trying to build, and that's why
we believe companies can confidently decide to pull down and start using
Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, and any of these projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And hopefully, become contributors to them, as well.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175396">Hyperledger, A Greenhouse for Blockchain Projects</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welcome to the Hyperledger greenhouse: an incubator for open
source blockchain technologies for business hosted by the Linux Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what does that mean exactly?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's start here, with you: you're a business, large or
small, participating in a commercial ecosystem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your business partners and peers want to do business with
you, but in order to do that, you'll need a ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This ledger contains a record of your transactions, along
with many, if not all of the other transactions in the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is vitally important to know that your copy of the ledger
is identical to everyone else's, so you'll need a distributed ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a new kind of network database that lets everyone in an
ecosystem keep a copy of a common system of record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But how does everyone agree on which transactions succeed or
fail?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's where Hyperledger software comes in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This plant is actually software. Software that each business
runs on systems it controls to broadcast out its transactions with other
parties and receive, validate, and interact with messages delivered by others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With any network like this, a particular software standard
is used to keep everyone in sync.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there are other ways to build these kinds of networks,
using different consensus algorithms and different smart contract languages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There will be many different ledger networks out there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ideally, they would all be able to interoperate due to
certain common properties, much like how the Linux community uses various
operating systems with a common kernel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Hyperledger, we're growing many different kinds of ledger
technologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, you'll find communities of software developers working
together to propel open source blockchain frameworks and tools into the future
to deployment and adoption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Businesses with strict blockchain requirements trust
Hyperledger because it's hosted by the Linux Foundation, and its projects are
developed by an open source community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developers can collaborate on a global level across company
and industry lines to create innovative, modular, open source components and
platforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's this open source approach that allows for the kind of
transparency, longevity, collaboration, community, and, of course, security
that blockchain needs to become more mainstream, which is what Hyperledger is
all about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger projects are meant to help you focus on
developing your business solutions and feel confident that the legal, technical
and organizational infrastructure is in place, thanks to Hyperledger and the
Linux Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are all open source projects, and anyone is welcome to
pick them up and use them, no fee or permission required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, this only represents a fraction of what open
source blockchain technologies can do now and in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, it's time to ask yourself: who will you trust with your
trust network?</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175397">Project Lifecycle and Hyperledger Incubator</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to the Hyperledger documentation, a&nbsp;<b>project</b>&nbsp;refers
to a collaborative endeavor to deliver a work item. Projects can vary in terms
of scope: some are intended to produce a document, some may develop new
capabilities or refactor/remove an existing capability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, open source initiatives use an incubation
process for new work items: this allows&nbsp;members of the community to
contribute&nbsp;new ideas and code in a more structured and transparent
workflow. Hyperledger has adopted a rigorous project lifecycle process that
has&nbsp;six possible states:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Proposal</b>&nbsp;<br>
If an open source initiative wants to be hosted under the Hyperledger
greenhouse, a proposal is submitted to the TSC for review. The proposal must
have a clear description and a well-defined scope, must identify the
development resources that are committed to the project, as well as the initial
maintainers, and must be vendor neutral.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Incubation</b><br>
Once a project proposal is approved, it enters the Incubation phase, and the community
has a chance to explore different idea related to the project. When a project
reaches a mature-enough stage and qualifies to be declared&nbsp;<i>Active</i>,
the maintainers will vote to submit a graduation review request to the TSC. All
projects ready to graduate from Incubation must have a fully functional code
base, test coverage commensurate with other&nbsp;<i>Active</i>&nbsp;projects,
an active and diverse community of developers, and a history of releases that
follow the&nbsp;<i>Active</i>&nbsp;release process. A project in the Incubation
stage is not guaranteed to eventually graduate - some projects never get
to&nbsp;<i>Active</i>&nbsp;state.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Active</b><br>
Projects that successfully exit the Incubation phase are considered&nbsp;<i>Active</i>.
If reasons exist, an Active project can be deprecated.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>First Major Release</b><br>
If the maintainers of a project are looking to publish the project's first
major release, they will have to obtain approval from the TSC.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Deprecated</b><br>
All deprecated projects are maintained for a six month period by their
communities; after that, the projects are removed from subsequent formal
releases. A deprecation notice is given to the public. After a six-month
deprecation period, projects are labeled&nbsp;<i>End of Life</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>End of Life<br>
</b>These are projects that are no longer developed or maintained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New projects wanting to join are evaluated on a number of
things:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How do they fit with the portfolio of other projects</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How mature are they, to understand where they're going</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Who are the developers around the projects, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a project goes through a rigorous vetting process and
graduates from the incubator, it signals to the public that they can now trust
the code, that the code can be used to build applications upon it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are sixteen projects in the Hyperledger greenhouse, as
of June 2019. And the door is open to new projects joining. There are four
fully-fledged Hyperledger projects, that have graduated from the Incubator and
are in an Active state (as of June 2019):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other projects are still working through the process,
and the goal is to get every one of them out of the Incubator.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175398">Hyperledger Labs</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, the Hyperledger Project Lifecycle is a very
rigorous process that includes 6 possible states. For a project to join the
Hyperledger Greenhouse, it must have a certain degree of maturity even in the
early proposal and incubation stages.</p>

communities) or experimental will thus get the opportunity to work in a space
suitable for innovation and testing of new ideas; moreover, they will work
within a legal framework that would ease the transition to the Hyperledger
Incubator (if the project matures enough and reaches that
stage).&nbsp;Hyperledger Labs have similarities with the Apache Labs and
the&nbsp;W3C&nbsp;Community Groups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a specific process that must be followed when
proposing a new lab.&nbsp;Labs that become dormant or unresponsive for 6 months
or more, or are deemed deprecated or obsoleted by their committers are
archived.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175399">Q/A with Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director of
Hyperledger</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Before diving deeper into the
projects advanced under the Hyperledger umbrella, we asked Brian Behlendorf,
Executive Director of Hyperledger at The Linux Foundation, some
questions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175400">Reasons Why Developers Would Become Interested in
Open Source Software</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, many of the students taking this course are more familiar
with working with Devs within the same room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But why do you think developers would be excited in becoming
involved with open source projects, such as Hyperledger?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, open source software represents, generally, the
largest software development classroom ever, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I was learning about software development as an
undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was taking classes, you know, I was learning kind of the
formal bits about, you know, data structures and algorithms, but the biggest
education came from sitting on development mailing lists around the standards
around HTTP and HTML, and, eventually, the software development mailing lists
and open source communities for the early days of the web.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And seeing, really, how software gets built, right, what are
the trade-offs, what are the negotiations, the back-and-forths, the messiness
of software development, which doesn't look that different than, say, how
Congress, you know, works on the bills sometimes, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes, it can be, you know, not very pretty, but you
realize that software engineering is as much a technical pursuit, as it is a
social pursuit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, in open source projects, I think we've figured out how
do we have technical differences of opinion and work through them, how do we
create the best software, the software with the greatest longevity, right? Why
should we document our code...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, it's because we don't want to have to answer silly
questions from the next person trying to understand what we wrote, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, all of this is a really great education, I think, in
understanding how to write higher quality code, whether that ends up being open
source code or not...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's one reason, I think, for developers to participate in
open source projects, whether at Hyperledger or any place else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other is that open source projects are a really good way
for you, as a software engineer, to understand what are the kinds of companies
I want to work for, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ones that are actively involved in open source projects,
right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do I get to know people at those companies, right? And
also, make them aware of my own skills, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And start to develop my own public history of my
contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These days, if you're a software engineer, if you're a
software engineer and you're applying to any place interesting, they're going
to look at your GitHub repository, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're going to want to know about your history of
contributions to open source projects as a way to evaluate your skills, and not
just technical, but also your communication skills, your collaboration
skills...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, all of that means working on open source projects can be
tremendously beneficial to your own ongoing education, as well as your ability
to build your career.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175401">Hyperledger vs. Apache</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>While at Apache, you were able to successfully build an open
software developer community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are some similarities and differences between
Hyperledger and Apache in its evolution as an open source project?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Right...Â  Well, on the Apache web server project, which
later became the Apache Software Foundation, a lot of what happened was due to
luck, was due to inheriting a tradition that had been established since the
beginning of the internet, of technologists working together on common
standards and common code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, there was kind of a DNA that was built-in and, you
know, the web was not that complicated at that point in time, either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These standards were pretty simple, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, we just kind of did what seemed natural. We started a
mailing list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We started an issue tracking system, a version control
system, and we just started working together, very ad hoc, very informally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we became a non-profit about three years after we got
started, when we realized we wanted a little more formalism, and a little more
protection for the developers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it was all very informal, ad hoc, and many developers
took on roles beyond development, such as marketing, such as legal, such as
accounting, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, Apache's culture has been very much almost like a
guild, right? Almost like a user community... a very community-driven kind of
thing, where there's this validity that comes from that
grassroots-kind-of-sense, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which is great for the kinds of projects that Apache was
interested in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Apache has become a home for over 300 different
individual software development projects, beyond the web server, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it has always grown by happenstance, and it's always
been open to whatever technology project wanted to come in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, there are some upsides and downsides to that all, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the downsides is, by not having a full time staff,
it's hard for Apache to really take advantage of all the opportunities out
there, to get the word out about who they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It means that developers, you know, have to do these
non-developer activities, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's hard to do things like police your trademark usage,
right, when people are working as volunteers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Linux Foundation took a slightly different approach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Linux Foundation said &quot;We don't...&quot; You know,
just like with Apache, &quot;we don't want to write software, we don't want to
have to pay all the software developers&quot;, because there's actually a lot
to the validity that comes from all of the software development happening by
volunteers, but there's a lot of non-software development things: marketing,
legal, PR, and even the hosting of meetings, the hosting of phone calls, all of
the logistics of helping these communities operate that perhaps can be taken
on, right, by a full-time staff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, how do you pay that staff, right? You could ask for,
you know, cutting charity contributions, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, a better, more scalable approach is to ask companies to
join as corporate members of an organization, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, they don't get any special privileges on the code,
right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, they don't get their patches in by default, they don't
get to veto anyone else's work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're a developer from IBM, there's no special status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have to still prove your worth, and to which, you would,
you know, and be seen as a peer to, say, a 15 year old kid in Romania, who also
is really eager to work on distributed ledgers and smart contract systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, but what members do get is some help in marketing
their activities, building on top of Hyperledger projects, ways to participate
at the events that we do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a journalist calls us and asks us for a story about
somebody doing something interesting with Hyperledger, we've got a set of
members that we... whose stories we can draw from, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, this balancing act of, you know... as I mentioned,
there's a developer community, and there's a commercial community, a corporate
community...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's the balancing act... that The Linux Foundation has
really developed a process for, a template for, and a real science around, and
that's what we're bringing to bear on the Hyperledger project.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175402">Interoperability Between Hyperledger Frameworks</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>What do you think will help foster interoperability between
these threeÂ  different Hyperledger frameworks?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, there's a number of things that we can do to assist in
the interoperability between the different projects at Hyperledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing we're working on is kind of an overall
architectural view of all the different projects, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the technologies that sit at kind of the DLT layer,
at the smart contract layer, where does identity sit in, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then, we can start to look at these projects and go,
&quot;Okay, could we put Fabric down here, could we put Burrow up here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe we start to tease apart the distributed ledger part of
Fabric from the smart contract part of Fabric, right, into separate components,
so that, when somebody new arrives at the project, or they take a training
course like this, they can start to pick and choose, you know, as building
blocks, as appropriate for whatever use case that they want to target, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, that's something over time, this kind of modularity
approach... Along with that, defining standardized APIs between these different
levels, right, so that we can get to an ideal, where you could pick the
Ethereum virtual machine from Burrow, and run that on top of Fabric or on top
of Sawtooth, and, in fact, the Sawtooth and Burrow communities have now
actually progressed, and you can now run Ethereum smart contracts on top of
Sawtooth, which is pretty cool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, I think we'll see more activity like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welcome to the Hyperledger greenhouse, an open source
consortium for developing business blockchain technologies hosted by the Linux
Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the greenhouse, diverse global communities
collaboratively develop open source projects that uniquely approach enterprise
blockchain challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These technologies can cross-pollinate and interoperate, just
like how the community is driving the projects, collaborate in an open and
neutral environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em>Hyperledger Burrow</em> is a modular blockchain
framework in the Hyperledger greenhouse, with a permissioned smart contract
interpreter, developed partly to the specifications of the Ethereum Virtual
Machine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart contracts provide the base functionality and
computational muscle within blockchain networks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart contracts are written into lines of code, and
distributed across blockchain networks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They can be configured to manage processes, exchange value,
or perform calculations, all without intermediaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because of its lightweight and fast smart contract design,
and the Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm with transaction finality,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Burrow is optimized for sharing processes across
organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Burrow operates as Hyperledger's library for Ethereum
Virtual Machine-based smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you wrote Solidity contracts for the public Ethereum
network, Hyperledger Burrow allows you to bring those smart contracts over to
Hyperledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Burrow helps organizations better meet their
cross-functional business needs, and opens the door for other Hyperledger
projects to incorporate the Ethereum Virtual Machine into their platforms.</p>

Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the greenhouse, diverse global communities
collaboratively develop open source projects that uniquely approach enterprise
blockchain challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These technologies can cross-pollinate and interoperate,
just like how the community is driving the projects collaborate in an open and
neutral environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em>Hyperledger Fabric</em> is an enterprise-grade,
permissioned distributed ledger platform in the Hyperledger greenhouse that
offers modularity and versatility for a broad set of industry use cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The modular architecture for Fabric accommodates the
diversity of enterprise use cases through plug-and-play components, such as
consensus, privacy, and membership services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the many compelling Fabric features is the enablement
of a network of networks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Members of a network work together, but because businesses
need some of their data to remain private, they often maintain separate
relationships within their networks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rather than an open, permissionless system, Fabric offers a
modular, scalable and secure platform that supports private transactions and
confidential contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fabric helps members manage confidential obligations to each
other without first passing it through a central authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That way, personal data isn't available to the entire
network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a member is not an agreed-upon party, the transaction
shouldn't appear on their ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This architecture allows for solutions developed with Fabric
to be adapted for any industry, thus ushering in a new era of trust, transparency,
and accountability for businesses.</p>

style='color:windowtext'>Hyperledger Fabric</span></a></span></span>&nbsp;is an
open source, production ready, permissioned blockchain framework implementation
that was designed to serve as a foundation for developing applications or
solutions with a modular architecture. It was the first proposal for a codebase
(2016), combining previous work done by Digital Asset Holdings, Blockstream's
libconsensus, and IBM's OpenBlockchain. It graduated from the Hyperledger
Incubator in March of 2017.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Its&nbsp;modular architecture allows components such as
consensus and membership services to be plug-and-play.&nbsp;One of the key
advantages of Hyperledger Fabric is that it&nbsp;allows entities to conduct
confidential transactions without passing information through a central
authority. This is accomplished through different channels that run within the
network, as well as the division of labor that characterizes the different
nodes within the network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welcome to the Hyperledger greenhouse, an open source
consortium for developing business blockchain technologies hosted by the Linux
Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the greenhouse, diverse global communities
collaboratively develop open source projects that uniquely approach enterprise
blockchain challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These technologies can cross-pollinate and interoperate, just
like how the community is driving the projects, collaborate in an open and
neutral environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em>Hyperledger Indy</em>, one of the frameworks in the
Hyperledger greenhouse, is a distributed ledger that provides tools, libraries,
and reusable components for creating and using independent decentralized
identities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the world becomes more interconnected, individuals are
disclosing personal information creating multiple usernames and passwords and
leaving digital traces across platforms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indy represents the idea of a self-sovereign identity, which
would dispose of the need for multiple logins and passwords.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rooted on a distributed ledger, this digital identity
interoperates across different domains, applications and organizational silos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, Indy puts identity control in the hands of the
user, not the organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Individuals will not have to rely on big organizations to
store and share their personal data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, the user controls what data they want to provide
access to and for how long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indy provides strong privacy guarantees because private data
is not written onÂ  the ledger, but exchanged over peer-to-peer encrypted
connections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A unique ID for each relationship ensures that data doesn't
leak from one relationship to the next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indy also ensures that both individuals and institutions
always know who they are dealing with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies can store less personal data and spend less time
and money trying to protect it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This combination of privacy and trust enables meaningful
interactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By providing a solution for digital credentials that
preserves privacy, Indy makes self-sovereign identities possible and practical
for individuals, institutions and Internet of Things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Get started with Hyperledger Indy today by downloading the
source code, accessing the documentation and joining our community from our
website: hyperledger.org.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hyperledger consortium has many different projects that
focus on different aspects of how ledgers can work and what use cases they can
be applied for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger purpose-built for
doing distributed identity, and what that means is, it allows you to have a
route of trust to manage the keys, schemas, proofs, and other information that
you need to, in order to enable trusted peer interactions between different
identities, as stored on a Hyperledger Indy blockchain instance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, if you have an identity it belongs to you, and only you,
and no one can pull the plug on you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And you can use that identity to manifest different
correlatable pieces of data between you and other identities you want to
interact with, without leaking private information or disclosing information
that you don't want shared across all those different aspects of who you are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when you control your identity, it makes it so that you
are also a party toÂ  the kinds of data sharing, claims, and proofs that can be
made about you, as information is shared across all the different interactions
you might do online.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the main use cases of Hyperledger Indy is to create a
global public utility for identity that's being created by the Sovrin
Foundation, which allows us to take these identifiers, and to anchor them on a
public ledger, so that different pieces of truth or pieces of information can
be trusted and shared with other people across the world, and they can be
trusted and validated, so that self-attested data can be shared, as well as
third-party attestations can be shared across all kinds of interactions and
across all kinds of data silos, and what this makes possible is the ability to
no longer have to function as an identity provider as a business, but to rather
let users authenticate based on the attributes that they're willing to store
and share themselves, which allows for GDPR-compliant use cases, where you're
expressing consent on behalf of the user, and also reducing the amount of
liability contained within a business, because the data can be kept with the user
and presented to you again in a way that you can trust and validate, that what
has been said, really was said, and is trusted by the other parties you do
business with.</p>

Hyperledger Indy &quot;provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for
providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers
so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and
any other silo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger Indy was contributed to the Hyperledger
greenhouse by the Sovrin Foundation in 2017, and it graduated from the
Incubator in March of 2019. It allows individuals to manage and control their
digital identities. Rather than having businesses store huge amounts of
personal data of individuals, Hyperledger Indy allows businesses to store
pointers to identity. Once the company verifies the other party's identity, it
throws it away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to Brian Behlendorf,</p>

<p><em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif'>&quot;(...)
identity is a toxic asset that could present a liability to
organizations&quot;.</span></em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, since 2013, over 14 billion data records were lost
or stolen. What is striking is that, out of these, only 4% were encrypted, and
hence, rendered useless after being stolen (also called &quot;secure breaches&quot;).

complex digital assets, from cryptocurrency to personal medical data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Iroha's built-in smart contracts, called commands, allow
developers to incorporate blockchain into their business processes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Iroha presents users with lower complexity and lower risk by
allowing them to perform common functions using built-in commands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This simplifies tasks, improves performance efficiency, and
allows less room for error.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Compared to other platforms, these commands also free up
developers by ridding them of the need to write complex smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Iroha, you can set up a network, create assets, and make
a transaction in about 5 minutes time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Iroha's consensus algorithm allows full Byzantine fault
tolerance with no mining, making it ideal for businesses that require
verifiable data consistency at low cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Users are able to interact with Iroha similarly to how they
would with a client server, so while some knowledge is required, you don't need

<h3><a name="_Toc91175412">Hyperledger Sawtooth</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welcome to the <em>Hyperledger greenhouse,</em> an open
source consortium for developing business blockchain technologies hosted by the
Linux Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the greenhouse, diverse global communities
collaboratively develop open source projects that uniquely approach enterprise
blockchain challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These technologies can cross-pollinate and interoperate,
just like how the community is driving the projects collaborate in an open and
neutral environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Built from the ground up for enterprise use, the <em>Hyperledger
Sawtooth</em> design philosophy targets development of decentralized ledgers
and secure, scalable smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sawtooth security model uses a single node type, which
simplifies deployment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Plenty of examples exist for both on-prem and cloud
installations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On chain governance lets enterprises manage all aspects of
the Sawtooth network with the network itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Participants add policies and agree on configuration changes
using Sawtooth transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, even consensus algorithms can be changed real time
in a running network: start with Raft, them harden with PBFT, or switch to
Proof of Elapsed Time as the network grows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sawtooth software development kits cover a wide variety of
languages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The smart contract model supports deploying any and all of
these languages alongside each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethereum contracts, for example, can be deployed alongside
WebAssembly and Java contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sawtooth distributed ledger technology can integrate with
existing internal databases by keeping internal relational and key/value
databases in sync with the Sawtooth network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whether you are using Sawtooth for healthcare, supply chain,
or financial services, your internal systems can make use of all the data
managed on the Sawtooth blockchain.</p>

</span></span>Supports creating and broadcasting events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Distributed ledger solutions built with Hyperledger Sawtooth
can utilize various consensus algorithms based on the size of the network (PoET
SGX, Raft, etc.). Hyperledger Sawtooth is designed for versatility, with
support for both permissioned and permissionless deployments. This technology
simplifies blockchain application development and deployment by clearly
separating the core system from the application domain.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175413">Hyperledger Sawtooth Characteristics Relative to Use
Cases (Dan Middleton)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, unique characteristics of Sawtooth... There's several,
but one that comes to mind for a provenance or supply chain use case, is that
that network will probably grow over time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reason that a lot of us are starting blockchain
networks, a lot of companies are invested in looking at blockchain networks, because
we think that we're going to be in them for a long time and they're going to
continue to grow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sawtooth is designed so that you can grow the size of the
network, you can actually change the consensus mechanism on the fly...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think this is a unique characteristic of Sawtooth amongst
all of the other ledgers...you can submit as a transaction and then have a
policy within your network to accept that new consensus, and then, your network
can move from say a PBFT-style consensus to something like PoET, or some sort
of random leader election consensus...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It allows you to have tens, or hundreds, or potentially
thousands of different nodes on your network, and you really can't beat that
kind of availability and integrity guarantees, or that kind of flexibility for
a network that needs to be up for years.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175414">Hyperledger Sawtooth - Supply Chain Use Case Example
(Courtesy of Sawtooth)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meet Rich: he owns a popular seafood restaurant in Boston,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rich strives to serve only the freshest, highest quality
fish to his patrons, but he often has difficulty knowing exactly where it was
caught, how it got to his restaurant, or if it's even the right species of
fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From ocean to table, the fish supply chain is difficult to
track, and usually follows this pattern: the fish is caught by a commercial
fisherman in the ocean, the fisherman then sells the fish to a market,
processor, or broker, a distributor then transports the fish to a restaurant or
grocery store for a consumer to purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rich typically only buys from one or two fish distributors
that he has built a foundation of trust and personal history with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He'd like to expand his menu by adding some different kinds
of seafood from other distributors, but he worries about integrity, and for
good reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He recently read a study by Oceana, which showed that 33% of
fish purchased from retail outlets is incorrectly labeled, and that illegal
fishing represents losses between 10 to 23 billion dollars worldwide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rich knows that mislabeled and illegally sourced fish could
hurt his customers, his restaurant's reputation, and the environment of our
planet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately for Rich and others in the seafood industry,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sawtooth Lake blockchain technology can provide an immutable
record of the provenance and lineage of various goods, like fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In combination with Internet of Things-enabled sensors,
Sawtooth Lake can manage the ownership and journey of fish from ocean to table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sensors can be attached to fish the moment they are
harvested, immediately and continuously recording data such as the location and
temperature of the fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, Rich can validate when and where his fish was caught,
and that it was stored properly on ice while it was transported.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sawtooth Lake platform can also manage the Chain of
Custody fish, enabling ownership to be transferred and traded on the blockchain
according to smart contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Sawtooth Lake as a traceability blockchain, Rich can
easily see which fishermen meet his quality standards and feels comfortable
doing business with new tradesmen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he serves up a new special to a cherished customer, he
can confidently and accurately assure her it's the type of fish she ordered, it
was stored at safe temperatures, when and where it was caught, how long it took
to get to her plate, and the fish's name... just kidding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sawtooth Lake blockchain technology can be used for a wide
variety of applications, from capital markets to international trade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Internet of Things ties the physical world to the
digital world, with Sawtooth Lake recording the generated data in a way that
all parties can trust its accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is extremely useful for tracking perishable goods, like
fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These sensors can track many key parameters, such as
location, temperature, humidity, motion, shock, and tilt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This technology could be added to any package or sensitive
good you're entrusting to other parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blockchain will ensure the data is secure and
tamper-proof, so that you know what you're getting, and that you get what you
pay for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sawtooth Lake creates a digital platform enabling physical
traceability in a trustless world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welcome to the Hyperledger greenhouse, an open source
consortium for developing business blockchain technologies hosted by the Linux
Foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the greenhouse, diverse global communities
collaboratively develop open source projects that uniquely approach enterprise
blockchain challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These technologies can cross-pollinate and interoperate,
just like how the community is driving the projects collaborate in an open and
neutral environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em>Hyperledger Caliper</em> is a blockchain benchmark tool
in the Hyperledger greenhouse that measures the performance of various
blockchain systems by using a set of predefined cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most users feel concerned or at least curious about the
performance of their blockchain solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, until now, there has not been a commonly accepted
blockchain benchmarking tool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Caliper brings to market the first tool that uses a set of
neutral and agreed upon rules to evaluate differing blockchain solutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to a customizable test flow and workload,
Caliper produces reports that contain performance indicators such as resource
utilization, transaction latency, and transactions per second, or TPS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every blockchain system today offers its unique strengths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Caliper allows users to understand the solutions that best
meet their use cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain developers can also use Caliper as an internal
tool to test the performance of different development versions, and since the
performance of blockchain systems varies within different configurations, Caliper
will be able to help users decide which configuration best suits their needs.</p>

a shared, reusable, and interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and
solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital

<p class=MsoNormal>Hyperledger Aries is related to both Hyperledger Indy and
Hyperledger Ursa (we will talk about this project later in this chapter). This
project aims &quot;to change the client layers in Hyperledger Indy to be
interoperable with other identity projects.&nbsp;The ultimate goal of
Hyperledger Aries is to provide a dynamic set of capabilities to store and
exchange data related to blockchain-based identity. These capabilities will
range from the secured, secret storage of data such as private keys, up to the
capability of globally accessible data that can be viewed and accessed by
anyone. An example of such support is the creation of a secure storage solution
similar to the wallet available in Hyperledger Indy today.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welcome to the Hyperledger greenhouse, an open source
consortium for developing business blockchain technologies hosted by the
LinuxFoundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the greenhouse, diverse global communities
collaboratively develop open source projects that uniquely approach enterprise
blockchain challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These technologies can cross pollinate and interoperate just
like how the community's driving the projects collaborate in an open and
neutral environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em>Hyperledger Quilt</em> is a toolset in the Hyperledger
greenhouse that offers interoperability between ledger systems by implementing
the Interledger Protocol, or ILP, which is primarily used to transfer value
across distributed and non-distributed ledgers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, value transfers are relatively easy if the sender and
recipient reside in the same country or own accounts in the same network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, since ledger systems are often siloed and
disconnected, problems arise when transferring value to a different payment
network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an enterprise-grade implementation of the ILP protocol,
Quilt can facilitate interoperability between different networks and values by
providing libraries and reference implementations of the core interledger
components.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With ILP, money can be packetized, routed, and delivered
over communication networks with automatic routing and a series of secure,
multi-hop payments, connecting bank accounts to digital wallets and everything
in between.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Long term, Quilt can become a ledger interoperability
solution that enables more than just payment transactions, but a means to
exchange any sort of asset across the many different blockchain networks that
will exist.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc91175429">Chapter 6: The Promise of Business Blockchain
Technologies</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter is designed to help you evaluate whether
blockchain tech, including the Hyperledger frameworks, are right for your
business, and where best to implement this new technology. We will cover the
ways different industries are using blockchain technologies today, and show you
some common features of blockchains that can provide efficiencies in business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The finance industry, in particular, put a lot of resources
behind blockchain tech early on. They have created blockchains and distributed
ledgers for transferring assets and recording trade agreements. Many types of
transactions, such as private company stock sales, bonds, options, and cash
transactions have all been recorded on permissioned blockchains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain technologies are very good at recording state
transitions. Just as the finance industry uses blockchain to record who owns an
asset at any given moment in time, the legal industry has also implemented
blockchain technologies to record property rights and the transfer of those
rights. It will be interesting to see how the courts adapt to recording
contractual agreements on both public and permissioned blockchains going
forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Insurance companies act as a trusted intermediary, pooling
funds from unaffiliated individuals. By holding these funds, they spread the
risk of catastrophe amongst all clients. Clients of these insurance companies
trust that, when something happens, the insurance company will pay them.
Blockchain tech may be able to disrupt the insurance industry, as they may
leverage the Hyperledger frameworks as a nexus of trust that controls claim
payouts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The healthcare industry has also found distributed ledger
technology to be useful to record and share data, such as patient health
records, or pharmacy information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several industries that deal with materials and product
supply chains have began using blockchain and the Hyperledger frameworks for
improved resource, sourcing, and allocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's take a look at different use cases for Hyperledger
blockchain technologies and see what advantages they can bring to your
business.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175430">Learning Objectives</a></h3>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175431">Business Blockchain Technologies Overview</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain is a data structure with an automated way to
enforce trust among participants. Consensus algorithms ensure that all
participants agree on the data stored within the blockchain. Blockchain opens
the door to disrupt any industry that relies on a central authority to confirm
authenticity. It also allows independent, and even competing organizations, to
share information to gain efficiencies across an industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In permissioned blockchains, a consortium of organizations
are responsible for authenticating and controlling the participants in a
blockchain. In public blockchains, no central authority or administration is
required to exchange data. Blockchains can drive business innovation through
controlled data-sharing networks for industry consortiums.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The promise of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to
simplify and automate key work functions has many industries taking notice.
Businesses recognize the efficiency gains from transitioning from closed and
proprietary solutions to standard open source capabilities, such as Hyperledger
business blockchain technologies. Several common project features of blockchain
applications are taking shape as the technology matures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How exactly are businesses using these emerging technologies
today? Next, we will explore the state of distributed ledger technologies in

<h3><a name="_Toc91175432">Hyperledger Advantages for Businesses (Brian
Behlendorf)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Technologists are studying the Hyperledger protocol and
applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What should business professionals know about the
Hyperledger project?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, business professionals who should... when they see the
word 'hyperledger', right, they should associate that with a set of principles
that have to do with the creation of high-quality, trustworthy software, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First of all, they should associate it with open source
development practices, they should know that any project that carries the term
'hyperledger', 'hyperledger foobar', 'hyperledger rhubarb', right, that these
are projects that have been collaboratively built, that have been vetted by
multiple developers working in concert on the technology, that it's as secure
as we can make it, because the code is out there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We try to hire folks to vet it, but we also...
fundamentally, you shouldn't trust software that you can't see the source code
to, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, that brand association, that trademark should really
come to be associated with open source, with security, as well as with a sense
of process, like something that can't just show up one day and become a
Hyperledger project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Technical Steering Committee has to approve any new
proposed submission, and they have a pretty high bar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our goal, again, is not to be the GitHub of projects, even
in the distributed technology, or distributed ledger, or smart contract space, but
to really have a high quality portfolio of these different efforts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, they should realize that they can build their business
on top of Hyperledger technologies, they can use it all day long, they don't
owe anybody a fee, a license fee, a patent license, nothing, and, if they feel
like it, if they want to contribute, there should be an easy glide path to
having their technical teams get deeper into the code, become contributors, and
even help set the direction for the technology.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175433">Business Interest in Hyperledger</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we first launched this course, in 2017, enterprise
blockchain technologies were still in&nbsp;the initial stages of their
production implementation. The concept of&nbsp;<i>blockchain</i>&nbsp;was at
the time mostly associated with bitcoin and cryptocurrency. But the situation
has significantly changed in the meantime, and while still considered
revolutionary and in early stages, enterprise-grade blockchain technologies
are&nbsp;now used in production, changing not only the way we do business, but
also the way we envision doing business in the future, as more and more use
cases and opportunities are created.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Smart contracts eliminate the middleman and add accountability
(used in various industry sectors, such as real estate, healthcare, government,
music, etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Internet of Things (IoT)-based blockchain applications add a
higher level of security,&nbsp; and transparency (in industries like supply
chain, healthcare, banking and financial services, automotive, cybersecurity,
etc.). Hyperledger Fabric is at the forefront of this revolution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Identity security is a key area where enterprise blockchain
technologies can make a difference,&nbsp;bringing, for example, a much-needed
reduction in identity fraud and theft claims, cutting the red tape of
government and local administration bureaucracy, and more. Hyperledger Indy,
Hyperledger Fabric, etc. are just a couple of technology examples successfully
used in production in this area.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Blockchain adds data transparency and automation to supply
management and logistics, building trust and enabling leaner, more
cost-effective processes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From smart companies, to smart cities, to smart energy
management, to streamlining supply chains and financial services, from
logistics to digital identities, across both public and private sectors, the
opportunities provided by enterprise blockchain technologies are astounding.
Talking about blockchain is now in the past;&nbsp;<i>it's now time to walk the
talk</i>! And the sky is the limit it seems!</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175434">Blockchain Use Case (Brian Behlendorf)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is your favorite blockchain use case?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, you know, what gets me up in the morning isn't so much
making Wall Street, you know, a few milliseconds faster or...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I mean, to some degree, it's nice to be able to talk about,
you know, bank payments taking five minutes, rather than three days, okay?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's kind of a win! But, I'd say, the use cases that wake
me up in the morning have more to do with positive social impact, alright?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Projects that, at the same time, is making a difference in
fighting slave labor, say, fighting the conflict diamond problems in the
diamond supply chain, or fighting the illegal fish catching and the slave labor
practices that happen in the fishing industry, by providing better provenance
tracking for the fish supply chain...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, I'm also very much intrigued by identity projects out
there, and the potential for distributed ledger applications to take something
like India's Aadhar, which is their national ID system, and reinvent that as a
decentralized privacy-protecting national ID system, rather than as a
centralized, potentially privacy-invasive central ID system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, lots of companies are starting to figure this out, lots
of companies with large amounts of customers are starting to figure this out, and
we certainly could do with fewer privacy breaches out there, and less
surveillance capitalism, which, you look at all these businesses... many of
them have business models based on learning too much about people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think through distributed ledger technology, ironically
enough, we can actually come up with systems that make management of the
distribution of personal data much easier to put in the hands of the
individuals themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, that's really what gets me excited.</p>

streamlining government services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will dive deeper into some of the industries that
are using blockchain-based solutions, as well as specific use cases.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175436">Supply Chain Management</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Supply chain management is an important piece of enterprise
resource planning (ERP). Supply chain management is the oversight of funds, raw
materials, components, and finished products, as they move from suppliers, to manufacturers,
to wholesalers, to retailers, to consumers. This movement can occur both within
one company, or among several companies. As assumptions change over time, the
supply chain models can begin to show weak performance metrics. Good supply
chain management will keep product quality consistent, and also prevent either
understocking or overstocking of inventory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stocking the right amount of inventory over time is also
known as supply demand synchronization, and is the key component in
just-in-time lean manufacturing and distribution. Companies want to ensure that
products are available when needed, but overstocking inventory is costly.
Companies that overstock perishable goods must discard items. Companies that
overstock non-perishable goods cannot use the money paid for those goods for
other purposes until the inventory is used. Furthermore, if the price of a good
drops while a company is storing excess inventory, then the company will lose
money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, there are weak points in the supply chain management.
These weak points occur where there are multiple ERP systems in use across
organizations. Data doesn't flow well through the handshakes or interface
points between systems. These weak points usually happen during transference of
ownership, or change in status between two parties. Visibility is limited at
the hand-off points of funds, raw materials, components, or finished products.
This lack of transparency is often intentional, as companies don't want to
expose their competitive advantages (e.g., an inexpensive supplier who delivers
quality products on time). Additionally, a company could be cut out of a supply
chain if members start transacting directly with that companyÂs suppliers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchains are being used to solve problems in supply chain
management by eliminating the need for a trusted third party to certify raw
materials, components, or finished products, as they travel through a supply
chain. Every participant, or node, contains a copy of all transactions. This
provides an audit trail of every transaction that has occurred in the system. A
change would be validated or rejected by the nodes in the system. Because all
participants have a copy of all past transactions in the network, any
participant can detect if a product is not as advertised. Instead of examining
raw materials, components, or finished products at several points in the supply
chain, a record of the inspection would be available and bound to the item as
it flows through the supply chain. Although a record of the transaction is public
and tied to the movement of physical items across the network, specifics such
as the quantity of goods, or the identity of the parties transacting, can be
done pseudo-anonymously in a blockchain. Such a granular view of movement
through supply chains improves resource allocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trade finance industry can also leverage information
visible in a supply chain blockchain. In its broadest sense, trade finance
manages capital required for international trade. Trade financing has become
the norm for cross border transactions, with the&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"inherit",serif;

href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/tradefinsme_e.pdf"
target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext'>World Trade Organization</span></a></span></span>&nbsp;estimating
that&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif'>&quot;up
to 80 percent of global trade is supported by some sort of financing or credit
insurance&quot;&nbsp;</span></em>(2016). An exporter needs to mitigate the risk
of non-payment, while an importer wants to mitigate the supply risk. The
function of trade finance is to act as a third party to remove the payment risk
and the supply risk, whilst providing the exporter with accelerated
receivables, and the importer with extended credit. Institutions that provide
capital during these trades can leverage the information visible in a supply
chain blockchain to better evaluate companies for lending.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175437">Supply Chain Case Study: Walmart</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As one of the world's leading businesses in the supply chain
industry, Walmart is constantly looking for ways to enhance transparency and
traceability in the food system, and over the years has tried numerous
solutions and approaches to solve this problem. Then, the hype of blockchain
caught their attention. They looked into various blockchain technologies that
could potentially be used to create a traceability system for their supply
ecosystem, such as Ethereum, Burrow, Hyperledger Fabric, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In partnership with IBM, they decided that Hyperledger
Fabric was the best fit for their needs (enterprisegrade, permissioned, open
source, vendor neutral, modular, plug-and-play). In October 2016, Walmart and
IBM announced the two projects they were focusing on: one on tracing the origin
of mangoes sold in US Walmart stores, and the other project was focusing on
tracing pork sold in its China stores.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based food traceability
system built for the two products worked. For pork in China, it allowed
uploading certificates of authenticity to the blockchain, bringing more trust
to a system where that used to be a serious issue. And for mangoes in the US,
the time needed to trace their provenance went from 7 days toÂ 2.2
seconds!&quot; As a result, Walmart and IBM worked on expanding the system,
both within and outside of Walmart;&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span

target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext'>IBM Food Trust</span></a></span></span>,
an ecosystem of producers, suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, etc., working
together to create a smarter, safer and more sustainable global food system,
was born.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, Walmart traces over 25 products from five different
suppliers using the IBM Blockchain built on top of Hyperledger Fabric: from
mangoes, strawberries and leafy greens, to meat and poultry, to dairy and
almond milk, and even multi-ingredient products like packaged salads and baby
foods.&nbsp;And it plans to expand the use of this system to include more
products and categories in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175438">Supply Chain Case Study: ScanTrust</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another great example of how blockchain technologies can be
a great solution for transparency and traceability in the supply chain industry
is that of Cambio coffee: if you buy a pack of Cambio coffee and scan the label
with your smartphone, you will be able to see all the details of the coffee's
journey, from harvest in Peru, to shipment, to roasting in Shanghai, and
delivery to your home. Cambio Coffee is a direct trade organic coffee company
that prides itself on building a direct link from coffee farmers to consumers,
and the immutable records that are stored on the blockchain are proof that they
stay true to their mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cambio Coffee worked with ScanTrust to implement a
traceability system built on top on Hyperledger Sawtooth. When ScanTrust
decided to implement a blockchain solution to enhance trust, transparency and
traceability in the supply chain, they wanted a reliable, proven, open source
technology, supported by an active community, and they decided that Hyperledger
Sawtooth was the best fit for what they needed, as it is also focused on IoT
implementations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ÂScanTrust plans to use the Hyperledger Sawtooth-based
solution for other projects. Besides enhancing traceability in the supply
chain, the team sees other uses for the technologyÂ A brand could create its
own token to incentivize consumers to share data; or it could develop ways to
allow consumers to tip the farmer who produced their coffee.Â</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175439">Property Rights</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The legal industry has begun to examine how blockchain
technologies can minimize disputes around property rights. Property rights are
a division of law whereby the rights and responsibilities associated with
owning an asset are established. Property ownership rights may include the
right to use the asset, the right to profit from the asset, the right to
exclude others from using the asset, or the right to transfer the asset to
others. Property ownership responsibilities may include tax liability for the
asset, maintenance and repair costs, or payment for injuries caused by unsafe
or defective conditions of the asset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ownership for a particular asset may be transferred in
whole, or in part. As a result, property rights or obligations attached to a
particular asset may belong to several different entities at the same time. For
example, if&nbsp;you purchase a plot of land, you have the right to use that
land. However, the usage of the land is most likely limited by the government.
The right to use the land may be taken away from&nbsp;you by foreclosure if you
do not pay property taxes. Similarly,&nbsp;your right to use the land is
limited to permitted uses per that areasÂ zoning laws. It is unlikely that you
will be allowed to operate a pesticide manufacturing plant in the middle of a
residential neighborhood. If&nbsp;you lease out the plot of land,&nbsp;your
right to use the property is transferred to the tenant, but&nbsp;you are still
able to sell the plot of land to another landlord while the lease is active.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Companies may use blockchain
technologies to record ownership rights and responsibilities. Specifically,
governments have put land registry records on blockchain (Laura Shin,&nbsp;</span><span

target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext'>forbes.com</span></a></span></span><span
style='background:white'>, 2016). Companies have also put intellectual property
registration and ownership on blockchain (</span><span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:windowtext;background:white;text-decoration:none'><a
href="https://poex.io/" target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none'>poex.io</span></a></span></span><span style='background:
white'>). Intellectual property includes copyright, trademark, and patents. To
legally protect ownership rights in these, one registers their production, or
invention, or otherwise proves when the work was established, and that they are
the origin of the work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Property Titles on a
Blockchain via a Smart Contract</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Companies with strong brand value in particular, such as the
fashion industry and luxury good providers, are interested in more efficient
ways to protect their intellectual property. When data is added to a
blockchain, it can provide an immutable, secure, timestamped record for the
creation of intellectual property, and any changes to the data can be easily
detected. Blockchains establish this in a variety of ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A blockchain may record a hash of a document. As an example,
photographers could place a hash of their unique digital photographs on the
blockchain. The hash of a digital photograph will be constant so long as the
photograph file has not been altered. Therefore, the blockchain can control and
track the distribution of the photograph, detect the introduction of
counterfeit images, and be used to resolve disputes as to who first introduced
the image. By placing a hash of intellectual property documents on the
blockchain, a party can publicly demonstrate data ownership, and prove the
existence of certain documents at a given moment in time, without revealing the
actual data. In addition to the hash, you may also choose to store the location
of the file in the blockchain, which could be used for retrieval.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175440">Provenance</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the previous section on blockchains for supply chain
management illustrated, blockchain data improves insight into products, as they
move through their lifecycle. Large enterprises are not the only parties to
benefit from this increased visibility. Consumers can also benefit from
blockchain technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Provenance is a record of ownership used as a guide to
authenticity or quality. Because of the overhead involved in traditional
provenance records, they were only available for very large ticket items, such
as works of art. With the efficiencies gained from blockchain technology,
provenance records can be available for a wider range of goods. This improved
information can aid consumers as they make purchasing decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do you, as a consumer, really know that you purchased an
authentic item? Why is authenticity important? Some consumers want to make sure
that fair trade and fair labor standards are upheld in the products they
purchase. Others want to make sure that none of their products have been tested
on animals. Still, others are concerned with the use of harmful chemicals
during product manufacturing. Those consumers are willing to pay a premium to
make sure that they are not funding operations that are not in line with their
values. Counterfeit products, however, take advantage of the higher price point
a brand that upholds strict standards can command. Their margins are increased
over the authentic brand because they cut corners during production.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It turns out that counterfeit products are a global problem
affecting several industries. For example, the European Union Intellectual
Property Office (EUIPO), in collaboration with the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), estimates that $48 billion worth of smartphone
sales were lost to phoney phones in 2015 (Karen Gilchrist,&nbsp;<span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

2017). Also, &quot;<em><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Inter",sans-serif'>the Interprofessional Council of Bordeaux Wine
estimates that 30,000 bottles of fake imported wine are sold per hour in
China&quot;</span></em>, whereby some estimate half of the wines retailing
for&nbsp;more than&nbsp;$35 in China are counterfeit (Pamela Ambler,&nbsp;<span

target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext'>forbes.com</span></a></span></span>,
2017).&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to be certain that your product is authentic, you
would need either a record of all the transactions for the life of the item, or
a trusted third party. Trusted third parties certify the authenticity or
quality of an item. They function as a new data layer between data silos, and
increase costs of transactions by charging for providing data and certifying
products. Some examples of&nbsp;such trusted third parties are the National
Organic Program (USDA Organic) for produce, Fair Trade USA for human worker
conditions, or the Gemological Laboratory of America (GLA) for jewelry,
diamonds, and gemstones. Blockchains can serve the function of these trusted
third parties by uniquely identifying products, and certifying their
authenticity. Alternatively, these trusted third parties can leverage
blockchains by recording their audits and inspections on blockchains. This
would reduce the overhead needed to certify products. For example, a
manufacturer could prove that its sources also abide by the certification
authoritiesÂ standards if those sources are listed on blockchains as having
passed all requirements. The timing of the sourceÂs original certification and
renewals could be viewed by any interested party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a consumer reading from a blockchain, you would be able
to verify a productÂs authenticity by seeing the full chain of custody for an
item. Hyperledger frameworks allow consumers to view important data attached to
the goods, without necessarily viewing exactly who conducted each transfer down
the supply chain line. Therefore, the promise is that you will be assured that
the product you are purchasing is an authentic product, without necessarily
allowing the public to view your purchasing habits, all leveraging distributed
ledger technology.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175441">Provenance Use Case: Circular</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>For years, consumers have been looking for ethically-sourced
products, and a well-known example is that of diamonds provenance. A much less
known conflict mineral&nbsp;is tantalum - a rare mineral used to make
capacitors found in devices like smartphones and laptops. Rwanda is the world's
largest supplier of tantalum; however, at times, tantalum is also smuggled in
from Congo, where children or enslaved workers are used to mine it. As a
result, there are many regulations passed by OECD (Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development), US, and EU (US Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, EU
Conflict Minerals law, etc.) aimed at improving traceability. Despite this
regulations, there has not been a reliable way to prove the source of tantalum.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain technologies have been a game changer. Circulor,
a UK-based company, has developed a system that traces the origin of tantalum,
ensuring it is mined, transported, and processed according to approved
regulations. This system is built on Hyperledger Fabric and delivers the first
mine-to-manufacturer traceability of tantalum. How were they able to succeed?
By creating a very tightly controlled system, that recorded the tantalum
journey every step of the way: from mining in Rwanda, to refining in Macedonia,
to manufacturing in USA, shipping from USA, final assembly in China, and the
distribution to consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The system went smoothly into production in the fall of
2018, and included, to start with, three mines in Rwanda and a refinery in
Macedonia. And the plan is to bring more mines into the system. On top of that,
Circulor aims to expand the system they built to cover other minerals and
countries.</p>

Payments, especially international payments, can be quite costly. Blockchain
technologies plan to decrease the costs associated with payments, by allowing
parties to interact directly, instead of transferring through an intermediary,
such as a bank. In addition, having a record of all past payments is useful to
auditors and regulators. Financial institutions have heavily researched
blockchain payment systems because a universally recorded world state of
payment information can decrease the number of payment disputes among
institutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The finance industry, in particular, has shown early
interest in blockchain technology.&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"inherit",serif;
color:windowtext'><a href="https://www.r3.com/about/" target="_blank"><span
style='color:windowtext'>R3</span></a></span></span>, a fintech company that is
a member of the Hyperledger consortium, has brought together more than 100
leading financial institutions to examine blockchain technology. The finance
industry has already recorded business transaction agreements on blockchain.
Currently, bonds, invoice financing, letter of credit transactions, and
interest rate swaps governed by an ISDA master agreement have all been recorded
on blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The financial industry would like to improve transaction
settlement through blockchain technology by leveraging smart contract
functionality for executing trades. Absent blockchain technology, a complex
process known as the post-trade cycle is initiated once parties
&quot;execute&quot; a trade. The post-trade cycle involves a series of steps to
verify the terms of a trade, and to transfer assets involved in the trade in
order to effectuate and settle the trade. Some trades are currently required by
law to go through a separate central clearing organization. This organization
steps in as the counterparty to each trade, creating two distinct contracts for
each trade. These organizations are central securities depositories, whose role
is to minimize the risk of trade default, and also to enforce rules against
overexposure to certain types of trades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although every trade has its own lifecycle, generally, the
following steps will occur:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Parties execute a trade. Executing a trade occurs when parties
agree on the details of a trade and are willing to enter into the deal.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>One party will draft an inception document, capturing all the
terms of the trade, and will send it to the other party to get the trade
confirmed.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The recipient of the inception document will check the details of
the trade and confirm the trade by signing and returning the document. Confirmation
communication is done often by Fax, SWIFT, or Telex.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The trade is allocated. For flexibility of profit and loss
booking, parties will often allocate the trade to various sub-entities within
their organization.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Each trade will be stored by the party who was allocated the
trade on an internal database. For ease of identification, the trade is
assigned a unique Trade ID as a standard identifier.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Post-Trade Changes are sometimes made by the parties. This can
occur when:<br>
- The trade can be amended with consent of both parties<br>
- One party may assign its position in the trade to a different party<br>
- A partial termination of the trade may be triggered if a change in the
notional of the trade that is not pre-fixed according to the agreement occurs<br>
- Termination of the deal before maturity of the trade may occur, which may
entail a termination fee.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Payment is made. These payments may be at the close of a trade,
or at intermediate stages while a trade is still open. When the payments are
made on an open contract, this is known as 'revaluation' and is done to
minimize the risk of nonpayment by a counterparty whose position has weakened
in the trade due to events that occurred after trade execution.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Audit of the trade and associated payments is performed by the
parties. If a dispute occurs, the parties must communicate and come to a
resolution for such discrepancies. This is a manual and costly process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>Smart contracts may greatly
improve the process of post-trade settlement, by reducing disputes and errors.
Smart contracts will ensure that final settlement will happen when the
execution of a trade occurs. With smart contract technology, a legal agreement
can automatically execute clauses within it.</span></p>

alt="Financial services blockchain use case"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The image above shows the automation of back-office
processes involved in trade confirmation and post-trade settlement via DLT. An
asset ledger stores ownership and transactions. Smart contracts allow the asset
ledger to handle collateral management and initiate payments per contract
terms. Venues (e.g. exchanges, MTFs, bilateral voice conversations) still match
trade requests with a counterparty, and provide price discovery. Querying
information on the asset ledger may assist&nbsp;with price discovery. The asset
ledger verifies the parties and asset ownership. It will then either accept, or
reject the trade. If, for example, the seller does not own the asset in
question, or the new trade would result in an illegal overexposure on the buyer
side, the trade would be rejected. When a trade is valid and accepted onto the
blockchain, the blockchain automates an immediate change in ownership, or a
delayed, or contingent asset transfer. The changes in asset ownership or
contract terms are securely recorded onto the asset ledger. The contract is
programmed to execute automatically, exchanging payments and other assets per
the terms agreed to by the parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is still unclear whether courts will enforce blockchain
contracts in the same way that they enforce traditional written contracts, with
inked paper signatures. Therefore, the current best practice is to record
trades on blockchain, alongside traditional legal documentation. The operative
clauses in the traditional written contract are converted into smart contract
templates to be placed on blockchain once a trade is confirmed. For example, a
full ISDA master agreement document would be stored on blockchain, and tied to
the smart contract governing the underlying swap or derivative trade. This
leverages the predictable outcomes of a legal contract with the efficiencies
that can be gained from distributed ledger technologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are both advantages and disadvantages to controlling
funds on blockchain. If funds arenÂt under the control of the smart contract,
then there is no way&nbsp;a payment can be guaranteed. If funds are controlled
by the partiesÂ smart contract agreement, then those payments can indeed be guaranteed
at the close of the trade. However, this also means that those funds cannot be
used by the partiesÂ for anything else throughout the lifecycle of the smart
contract. Today, a party may use the funds separate from the contract. This
exposes the other party to the risk of nonpayment, but frees up capital for
other purposes. The connection between risk and return is not a problem that
blockchains can solve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Conducting post-trade settlement in an automated way through
smart contracts promises to introduce efficiencies, and reduce friction
associated with trades. However, the industry has experienced some barriers to
the adoption of blockchain technologies. Primarily, data privacy rules have
come into conflict with the way standard blockchain protocols operate. Some
regulations in the finance industry will not allow you to share information, or
store it on a shared medium, even if it is encrypted. In addition, regulations
covering securities professionals specify how ownership of certain assets must
be recorded and properly transferred. Securities professionals include
broker-dealers and investment advisers. These rules were written without the
anticipation of blockchain technologies, and are at odds with the fully digital
transference of assets over blockchain technologies. Either these regulations
will need to adapt to blockchain technologies,&nbsp;or blockchain technologies
will need to introduce new features conforming to existing regulations. The
adoption of blockchain technologies for post-trade settlement will likely
change the role of governments in the financial oversight. There will be less
of a need to enforce individual trades and resolve settlement disputes, but the
government may collect better data on existing trades by viewing and querying
the blockchain. With this increased insight into the market, the government may
or may not develop stronger standards for trades through smart contracts.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175443">Healthcare</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of multi-party processes in the healthcare industry
can leverage distributed ledger technology. By streamlining these multi-party
processes, the healthcare industry can reduce the time and expense of
collecting and verifying multiple pieces of information in order to deliver
quality care to patients. Healthcare providers and insurance companies have
begun to explore how blockchain can improve the delivery of patient care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2015, the US spent 27.42% of the federal budget, or $1.05
trillion, on healthcare (<span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/"
target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext'>National Priorities Project</span></a></span></span>).
Because these costs are so high, the US government, in particular,&nbsp;has
invested resources into healthcare blockchain technology. The&nbsp;<span
class=MsoHyperlink><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Inter",sans-serif;color:windowtext'><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/"
target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext'>Office of National Coordinator
for Health Information Technology (ONC)</span></a></span></span>&nbsp;is
responsible for health information technology. It has recognized a need for
nationwide interoperability and standards for electronic health records, claims
processing, and verification of provider credentials. To that end, it has
sponsored many government blockchain initiatives in healthcare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The healthcare industry has already placed medical insurance
enrollment information on blockchain for verification, and plans to incorporate
many other aspects of medical insurance claims processing on blockchain. One
cost borne by health insurance providers is auditing care providers. Health
insurance providers must verify whether a practitioner actually delivered the
care that he or she was obliged to deliver to the patient. Health insurance
providers must also audit the financial aspects incurred as part of this care,
to ensure that care was paid, and the charges were accurate. Tying the care
auditability with the payment auditability provides a key advantage to reducing
the potential for fraud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The healthcare industry has examined placing prescription
drug fulfillment processes on blockchain since they involve gathering and
checking information from many sources. Insurance benefits investigation
eligibility checks are performed to see if insurance will pay. Prior
authorization and step therapy requirements are checked to see if a patient is
able to receive a particular drug, or if other drugs are preferred. Formulary
checks, patientsÂ assistance checks, and pharmacy stock checks must all be
performed. The healthcare industry has also used DLT to handle online identity
management, by uploading verified pieces of a healthcare professionalÂs
credentials for license verification.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175445">Education Case Study: Sony Global Education</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We've all experienced the process of enrolling in higher
education or applying for a skilled job -&nbsp;no two applications&nbsp;are the
same, as each institution uses their own individual application and validation
processes. Similarly, the credentials we must have when applying each require
different validation process as well. Needless to say, this is a rather long
and complicated process. Sony Global Education has identified in Japan the need
to create a comprehensive, open and trusted system to record educational and
training credentials of Japanese citizens. But this need is not limited to
Japan alone - it spans worldwide. As such, Sony Global Education aims to create
a system that will store&nbsp;this siloed data into one system,&nbsp;gathering
people's academic and training credentials and then controlling access to this
recorded data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sony Global Education decided to use Hyperledger Fabric, as
it is a trusted, secure, open source, platform. The solution they designed was
already tested successfully. Moreover,&nbsp;Sony Global Education is working
with the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to develop a
next-generation system&nbsp;for managing digital transcripts based on their
tested solution, aiming to secure the authenticity of transcripts and allow
them to be safely shared within a trusted network.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175446">Smart Energy Management</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We live in an increasingly connected and energy-dependent
world. Balance between supply and demand is imperative to
ensure&nbsp;electricity demand is met. However, the increasing demand in
electricity adds increased pressure on conventional energy sources.&nbsp;For the
most part, the existing electricity grid is coping with the existing demand;
however, when unexpected events occur (weather-related, for example), the
pressure exerted on this grid can reach dangerous, unsustainable levels. And
with the advent of increased dependency on electricity in day-to-day life, time
will come when conventional resources will no longer be sufficient. Drastic
times require out-of-the-box solutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enterprise-grade blockchain technologies are playing an
increasingly important and innovative role in an increasing number of industry
sectors, including the energy sector. In 2017, IBM partnered with TenneT,
sonnen and Vandebron&nbsp; to develop a&nbsp;<span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'><a
href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/52243.wss" target="_blank"><span
style='color:windowtext'>distributed database for managing the electricity grid</span></a></span></span>&nbsp;in
the Netherlands and Germany:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>TenneT is focusing on finding new sustainable ways to cope with
the increasing dependency on and demand for electricity.&nbsp;In their quest to
maintain the supply-demand balance, TenneT is exploring the use of a
Hyperledger Fabric-based permissioned blockchain network that will integrate
renewable electricity sources (such as electric cars and household batteries)
in the energy grid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>TenneT and Vandebron are running a pilot project in the
Netherlands to test this potential solution.&nbsp;<em><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Inter",sans-serif'>&quot;Vandebron will
work with customers who own an electric vehicle to make the capacity of their
car batteries available to help TenneT balance the grid. Vandebron will provide
this service to its customers without compromising the availability of their
car battery. The blockchain enables each car to participate by recording their
availability and their action in response to signals from TenneT.&quot;</span></em>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>TenneT and sonnen are running another pilot project in Germany,
focusing on re-dispatch&nbsp;efforts to prevent regional overloads on the
energy grid by integrating renewable energy sources into the electricity supply
network. In Germany, this would be needed, for example, when wind energy
produced in northern Germany cannot be transported to industrial centers in the
southern part of the country. To solve this issue, a&nbsp;network of
residential solar batteries aims to reduce the pressure of&nbsp;the
distribution limitations. The blockchain network will allow the TenneT operator
to see available, ready-to-activate residential solar batteries, and then
record the batteries'&nbsp;input to the electricity grid.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175448">Blockchain Best Practices for Enterprises</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The use of distributed ledger technologies&nbsp;in
production across various industries continues to expand and reach new
horizons, as businesses explore new ways to incorporate blockchain in their
day-to-day activities. However, in order to increase the success of blockchain
business applications, some best practices must be considered:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Security for the long term</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
While blockchain transactions are secure and cryptographically protected when
it comes to the current technological advancements, we should always keep in
mind that nothing is static, and technology continues to advance at an
incredibly fast pace. What is secure today may not be so in the near
future.&nbsp;Hackers and other bad actors are constantly focusing on breaking
the cryptographic algorithms that protect blockchain data today.&nbsp;<br>
<i>To avoid the potential security disruptions of tomorrow, a critical best
practice is that users should never put personally identifiable information, or
PII, on their blockchains.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>File storage on the blockchain</b><br>
Due to the way blockchains work to store data, replicating it on every other
node or peer in the network, storage and compute costs can be incredibly
high.&nbsp;<i>To avoid added storage costs, it is recommended that other
storage and replication&nbsp;methods to be used - this includes cloud networks
like AWS S3, GCP Filestore, etc.</i>&nbsp;This way, nodes and peers&nbsp;can
have pointers or links to the data files kept outside of the blockchain
network, instead of the actual data.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Permissioned blockchain for private data</b><br>
On public blockchains, anybody has access to the information stored on the
network: they can add transactions and read the data that is in it. When it
comes to permissioned blockchains, data can be stored, accessed and used only
between partners that have access to it.&nbsp;<i>Permissioned blockchains, such
as the Hyperledger technologies, are a great solution for businesses, as they
want their data to remain private.</i></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Blockchain governance</b>&nbsp;<b>structure</b><br>
Most blockchain-related challenges are related to the governance model that is
chosen.&nbsp;To keep things straightforward, you should define the governance
structure upfront very early in the process, even before diving into
blockchain: decide how new users/organizations are added to a blockchain
network, how to determine if a user/organization should be removed from the
blockchain network, include a mechanism that deals with and removes bad actors
previously allowed in the network, etc. Keep in mind that things change over
time, and as such, the governance procedures may change as well.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Performance and scalability requirements</b><br>
Blockchain architects must have a clear understanding of the requirements for
their specific use cases, and they must ensure that their blockchains meet
those requirements.&nbsp;Based on these requirements, decisions must be made
early on with each deployment and use case in regards to what technologies to
use.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Goals of blockchain business cases</b><br>
Not every project or&nbsp;solution&nbsp;is successful, unless it is carefully
planned, designed and implemented.&nbsp;<i>A carefully thought out strategy
must be designed and implemented for each project, to ensure that goals are
achieved.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain can be a great solution for numerous business use
cases that rely on security, controlled access, accountability, transparency,
and efficiency, spanning a wide range of industries, from finance to banking,
supply chains, manufacturing, healthcare, telecom, etc.&nbsp;Having well laid
plans, goals and best practices can all help enterprise IT leaders explore the
growing blockchain ecosystem as they work to capture its strengths for their
businesses.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175450">What Enterprises Look for When Evaluating Whether or
Not to Use Hyperledger (Brian Behlendorf)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>What should an enterprise look for when evaluating whether
or not to use Hyperledger?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, I always try to start... suggest that people start with
the business need, right, trying to look at what are you doing in your
enterprise, and probably, it will mean what are you doing with your business
partners, with your suppliers, with your customers, maybe even with your
competitors, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is it... what are some business processes, or some
provenance tracking problems, or a registry somewhere that, you know, you're
putting too much trust in a central org somewhere, where is there an
opportunity to take a decentralized ledger approach, and a smart contract
approach to solving those issues?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Start with the need, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, one way to explore that is, you know, every
industry has a consortium somewhere in that industry talking about technical
standards, talking about common business processes, and those are often the
right kinds of organizations to look at doing a proof of concept with, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because they often have kind of this overarching kind of
view of the industry, and they tend to be trusted by the participants in that
industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, often, they could come up with what's the right kind of
proof of concept, or maybe even a Minimum Viable Product kind of project,
because there really is no blockchain of one, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's really hard just to think about solving your own
problems with a block, with a distributed ledger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You really need to think about an industry-wide kind of
approach, even from the earliest day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you've identified like that kind of opportunity, you
should start to ask yourself what are the characteristics of that need, is it
from a transaction rate perspective, from a number of nodes, from how
geographically distributed those nodes might be, and then, also ask yourself
who are the developers that I'm expecting to be able to tap, to bring this
technology to bear, and have they started to investigate distributed ledger
technology, have they started to learn how Fabric works, how Sawtooth works...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, I think that that's another important side of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the business side of the house is trying to understand
the use cases, you should really let your technology teams explore this
technology, allow them to get their hands dirty, to go to a hackathon, to take
this course, to start playing with these technologies to get a more intuitive
sense for what they do, and what they can't do, right, what their limitations might
be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is still very early days, and you still need to be
smart about how do we apply these and how do we use them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, at some point, those two teams should meet up, right,
and say &quot;Here's what we think is really the MVP [Minimum Viable Product]
or a proof of concept&quot;, and the other team should... that comes from the
technology side of the house, should say &quot;Okay, we understand how to build
this, you know, if we, you know, shave these corners, we can do something in a
week&quot;, right? and let's just see that, you know, cheap and dirty, what it
looks like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then, over time, start to promulgate that amongst the
other partners that you think you'd involve in a distributed ledger project.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175451">When to Use Blockchain</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are certain factors to consider when evaluating
blockchain distributed ledger technology&nbsp;for your business. How many
participants are in your system? What is the geographical distribution of the
participants? What sort of performance requirements do you have? Defining the
rules, risks, and responsibilities of each party in your blockchain system is

<h3><a name="_Toc91175452">When Not to Use Blockchain</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain technology is a powerful tool, but it is not
always the right tool for the job at hand. If you are contemplating using
blockchain technology, be sure to evaluate the problem fully.&nbsp;The
following conditions are not currently well suited to blockchain-based
solutions:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The process involves confidential data</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The process stores a lot of static data, or the data is quite
large</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Rules of transactions change frequently</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>Â·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The use of&nbsp;external services to gather/store data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we will discuss in more detail the&nbsp;conditions
that are not well suited to blockchain-based solutions.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175453">I. The Process Involves Confidential Data</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>The biggest advantage and
challenge in deploying blockchains is the radical transparency which they
provide. Methods are being developed to hide confidential data on the
blockchain, while sharing it only to relevant parties. Regulations for data
privacy often do not allow for blockchain solutions. A thorough review of the
relevant privacy rules governing your business case should be examined to see
whether blockchain is appropriate. For example, is leaking data in encrypted
form allowed? What level of encryption is required when transmitting data?</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175454">II. The Process Stores a Lot of Static Data/Data Is
Quite Large</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>With blockchain technology,
the entire database is stored across many nodes in a blockchain system. Because
the replication factor of these systems is so high, they are best suited to
databases that have many state changes, or store only the minimum necessary
amount of information. If the data is relatively static, or if the files to be
stored are quite large, a different technical solution may be more appropriate.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175455">III. Rules of Transactions Change Frequently</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>If the rules around how your
business processes are conducted change frequently, or change in unexpected
ways, then blockchain may not be well suited for your use case. The rules of
transactions in blockchain are often pre-set, and smart contracts do not change
execution paths once they have been initiated. Everything that takes place on a
blockchain must be completely deterministic. Additionally, blockchains are
append-only databases. A relational database may be more suitable if you need
to make many changes to your data as the rules of your transactions change.</span></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175456">IV. The Use of External Services to Gather/Store
Data</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A blockchain smart contract does not currently initiate the
retrieval of external data. Instead, one or more trusted parties
(&quot;oracles&quot;) must create a transaction which embeds that data in the
chain. This data is often gathered and stored in a traditional database by the
oracle. Any interaction between a blockchain and the outside world is
restricted to regular database operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other words, an oracle pushes data onto the blockchain,
rather than a smart contract pulling it in. Once the oracle pushes the data,
every node will have an identical copy of this data. This allows for the data
to be safely used in a smart contract computation. While oracles allow for
blockchain interface with external data, they undermine the goal of a
decentralized system. Examine when such a trusted authority should be retained.
When the trusted authority would or should be retained, efficiencies in the
blockchain are not as high as in other applications.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc91175457">V. Simpler Alternatives</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:white'>For some applications, other
options are simply more efficient. When evaluating blockchain technology, consider
whether regular file storage, a centralized database, or database replication
with master/slave relationship between the original and copies is suitable. If
those structures are suitable, then you can deploy your application with
reduced complexity. Do you need a smart contract or are stored procedures
written in an extension of SQL sufficient? Similarly, some applications can
simply utilize cryptographic methods common in blockchains, without the
database replication mechanisms of a blockchain.</span></p>

provides generalized, high-level decision points about when to use or not to
use blockchain technology for your business.</span></p>
